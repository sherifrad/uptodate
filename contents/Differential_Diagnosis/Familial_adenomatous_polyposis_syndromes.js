"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cannot be definitively distinguished by any key characteristics in the personal history or physical examination. However, if the patient is from a FAP kindred with a known adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation, then this diagnosis is very unlikely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Germline DNA testing for bi-allelic MutYH mutations. [24]  [25]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Family history of juvenile polyposis. Patients may present with iron deficiency anaemia, obstructive symptoms, or evidence of a gross GI bleed. A subset may have clubbing of fingernails and telangiectasias.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Juvenile polyps in the stomach, small bowel, and/or colon. Polyps are juvenile retention polyps with mucin. Germline testing for SMAD4, BMPR1A, and PTEN gene mutations may be positive. Patients with SMAD4 mutations may also have hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasias.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar. Hyper-pigmentation of the buccal mucosa and lips are commonly seen. Small bowel intussusceptions and/or obstruction is a common presentation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Polyp histology shows hamartomatous lesions. STK11 genetic testing may be positive.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy shows both flat and pedunculated polyps, with flat polyps &gt;1 cm in diameter in the right side of the colon. Histology reveals both hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps; the right-sided polyps may also have sessile serrated adenomatous features histologically.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy shows flat polyps, particularly in the right side of the colon, &gt;1 cm in diameter. It is important to distinguish these polyps from the hyperplastic polyps of &lt;6 mm diameter in the left side of the colon and in the rectum, which occur without larger right-sided hyperplastic polyps and which have no known malignant risk.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can cause abdominal pain, haematochezia, chronic diarrhoea, recurrent intussusceptions in children.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Endoscopically, multiple polypoid lesions may be present throughout the colon or in a segment of the colon. Pathology reveals lymphoid hyperplasia, not adenomatous tissue.</p>",
