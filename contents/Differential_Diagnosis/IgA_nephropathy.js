"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by the presence of systemic symptoms, including purpuric rash (90% of cases); abdominal pain (85% of cases); joint pain (70% of cases); peripheral oedema; and GI bleeding.HSP is not recurrent or persistent. [2]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There are no differentiating tests, and histopathological findings are very similar. [2]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More common in females.Does not usually progress to end-stage renal disease.Gross haematuria is uncommon. [3]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Under electron microscopy the basement membranes appear diffusely attenuated and there is no mesangial expansion under light microscopy.Immunofluorescence studies do not demonstrate IgA deposits within glomeruli. [3]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Family history of renal failure, primarily in males.This is an X-linked dominant disorder associated with neural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities. [3]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electron microscopy shows longitudinal splitting and thickening of the lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane.In addition, a3, a4, and a5 chains of type IV collagen are absent in the basement membrane.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Develops within 1 to 3 weeks after the onset of streptococcal infection.hypertension and oedema frequently occur.Recurrent haematuria is not characteristic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated levels of antibodies to streptococcal antigens (anti-streptolysin O or anti-DNase B) are a good diagnostic clue.C3 is usually low in the first 2 weeks of infection.</p>",
