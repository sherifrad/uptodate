"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents with loss of consciousness or period of decreased alertness, potential seizure activity (or loss of bowel and bladder continence), headache, weakness or sensory changes, or changes in cognition, speech, or vision.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT will show subdural/epidural fluid collection.In subdural haematomas, fluid is usually crescentic in shape and can cross suture lines; a midline shift may be noted.In epidural haematomas, fluid collection shows lenticular shape that does not cross suture lines.Cerebral swelling may be manifested as the loss of grey-white matter distinction. Subdural haematomas that have a hypodense 'swirl' inside them signify potential hyperacute haematoma with active bleeding. Diffusely hypodense and isodense subdural haematomas indicate chronicity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Positive FHx (autosomal dominant), hx of fractures after minor trauma or deafness, discoloration of the sclera to a blue-grey colour (osteogenesis imperfecta [OI] types 1 and 3), dental discoloration, poor muscle tone.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-ray reveals wormian bones, reduced bone density, and evidence of multiple fractures.Mutation analysis of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes from fibroblast RNA may also be performed. Genetic testing is possible in a few centres, but is expensive. Genetic testing is only recommended in OI types 2 and 4; other types are diagnosed clinically and radiologically.Skin biopsy and culture of fibroblasts may be performed, enabling a collagen synthesis assay that may show quantitative or qualitative differences in collagen in patients with OI.</p>",
