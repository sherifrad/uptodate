"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The presence of galactorrhoea suggests prolactinoma.While macroprolactinomas may present with similar clinical pictures to nonfunctional pituitary macroadenomas, microprolactinomas in pre-menopausal women may present with amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea, and with impotence and lack of libido in men. Hypogonadism in non-functional pituitary microadenomas is rare.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Need to consider serial dilution in those with large pituitary macroadenomas (&gt;3 cm) to rule out hook effect secondary to very high prolactin levels, which results in only mild to moderate elevation of assay reported prolactin level (not necessary in labs using 2-step assay for prolactin measurement).

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>GH secreting adenoma (acromegaly)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These are macroadenomas in about 75% of cases. Patients typically have coarsening of facial features and acral enlargement.Other signs and symptoms may include skin tags, macroglossia, HTN, arthropathy, hyperhidrosis, symptoms associated with sleep apnoea and glucose intolerance/diabetes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An age- and sex-matched IGF-1 is typically elevated and patients fail to suppress GH to less than 1 microgram/L (1 nanogram/mL) during oral glucose tolerance test.The immunostaining of the tumour will show diffuse staining for GH and may also be positive for prolactin.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>ACTH-secreting adenoma (Cushing's syndrome)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These tumours are typically microadenomas and cause classic symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, including skin atrophy, easy bruising, facial plethora, central adiposity, muscle wasting and wide (&gt;1 cm) purplish striae.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Hypercortisolaemia is documented with an elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol, elevated midnight salivary cortisol or lack of cortisol suppression (&lt;50 nanomol/L [&lt;1.8 microgram/dL]) during 2 days low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.The immunostaining of the tumour will show diffuse staining for ACTH and patients would develop adrenal insufficiency after successful resection of an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>TSH secreting adenoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients present with typical features of hyperthyroidism such as palpitation, tremor, weight loss and diaphoresis.The pituitary tumour is usually a macroadenoma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The free T4 and free T3 levels will be elevated in the setting of a normal or slightly elevated TSH. The alpha subunit is usually elevated.The immunostaining of the tumour will show diffuse staining for TSH.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Rathke cleft cyst</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rathke pouch remnants may develop to cysts of different sizes and be localised in the sellar and suprasellar region.Rathke cleft cysts are usually discovered incidentally but rarely may present as space-occupying lesions and be associated with mass effect such as hypopituitarism.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The CT feature of Rathke cleft cyst consists of a low-density, well-circumscribed, non-enhancing sellar mass that may be associated with suprasellar extension. On MR images, Rathke cleft cysts may show various signal intensities but frequently are hyperintense on T2-weighted image.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Craniopharyngioma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Commonly seen in children but also has a second peak in adults in their sixth decade.Patients may present with symptoms related to diabetes insipidus, such as polyuria, polydipsia and nocturia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A cystic suprasellar lesion would suggest craniopharyngioma. Presence of calcification, which is best seen on CT scan, in up to 70% of patients would further support the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Meningioma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Meningiomas occur more frequently in women with a peak age between 40 and 50 years.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A dense homogenous enhancement on MRI and the presence of calcification on CT scan supports the diagnosis. The presence of a dural tail sign would suggest the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Hypophysitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Nine times more common in females and commonly affecting young women during late pregnancy or in the postpartum period.There is increased association with other auto-immune disorders such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The chronologic association with pregnancy or postpartum and isolated ACTH deficiency may be clues to its diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Sarcoidosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Neurosarcoidosis is seen in about 5% to 10% of individuals with sarcoidosis. It is more common in African Americans and frequently occurs in adults aged 25 to 50 years.It can be associated with various degrees of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Among suggestive MRI findings include thickened pituitary stalk and leptomeningeal enhancement. Patients should have chest radiograph to look for systemic disease. The definitive diagnosis requires biopsy.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Infections</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most patients with pituitary abscess present with symptoms related to mass effect (including headache), which at times can be very debilitating.Pituitary tuberculoma presenting as an isolated CNS lesion, without systemic involvement, is very rare.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The differentiation of pituitary abscess from non-functioning adenomas is difficult both clinically and radiologically. Pituitary abscess may be seen as a non-enhancing sellar mass with thick wall on MRI imaging.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Pituitary hyperplasia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Enlarged pituitary gland secondary to pituitary hyperplasia can be seen in pregnant women, patients with primary hypothyroidism, primary hypogonadism and post-menopausal women.Proper identification is important to prevent unnecessary surgery.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The MRI usually shows an enlarged hill-shaped sellar mass thath enhances homogenously following contrast.</p>",

"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Suprasellar or intrasellar aneurysms of the carotid arteries or suprasellar aneurysms of the anterior and posterior communicating arteries can clinically resemble expanding pituitary tumours.Based on their location, they may present with mass effect (e.g., visual field deficit and hypopituitarism).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Aneurysms of sellar region may present with various signal intensities on MRI if partially thrombosed. MR angiography is used to confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Metastatic lesions</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is usually a known history of malignancy, typically from breast, lung and kidney cancers.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT and MRI findings may suggest the diagnosis with extensive bony erosion, pituitary stalk thickening and heterogeneous sellar mass. Diabetes insipidus is a common clinical finding in up to 70% of patients. [39]  Rapid tumour growth on follow-up MRI supports the diagnosis.</p>",
