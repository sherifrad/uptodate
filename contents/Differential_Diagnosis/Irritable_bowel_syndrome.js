"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fever and rectal bleeding. Other signs may include presence of oral ulcers, perianal skin tags, fistulae, abscesses and sinus tracts; abdominal exam may reveal a palpable mass in the ileocaecal area; no mass present on digital rectal examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool culture, microscopy and antigen testing: negative.Upper GI and small bowel series: oedema and ulceration of the mucosa with luminal narrowing and strictures. CT/MRI abdomen: skip lesions, bowel wall thickening, surrounding inflammation, abscess, fistulae.Colonoscopy: aphthous ulcers, hyperaemia, oedema, cobblestoning, skip lesions.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with bloody diarrhoea, hx lower abdominal pain, faecal urgency, presence of extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., erythema nodosum, acute arthropathy), hx of primary sclerosing cholangitis. No mass present on digital rectal examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool culture, microscopy and antigen testing: negative.Histology: continuous distal disease, mucin depletion, basal plasmacytosis, diffuse mucosal atrophy, absence of granulomata and anal sparing.Colonoscopy: rectal involvement, continuous uniform involvement, loss of vascular marking, diffuse erythema, mucosal granularity, normal terminal ileum (or mild 'backwash' ileitis in pancolitis).</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The patient with lymphocytic or collagenous colitis will have soft to watery diarrhoea that often is not associated with pain and tends not to be episodic. Physical examination is normal.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood chemistry: may reveal azotaemia and hypokalaemia.Endoscopy and histology: although the colon mucosa may look normal endoscopically, there will be abnormal changes histologically on colon biopsies.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with coeliac disease usually have weight loss. The physical examination is usually negative. Some patients with coeliac disease will have early osteoporosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Basic laboratory tests: may show iron-deficiency anaemia, hypocalcaemia, or a prolonged prothrombin time, although many patients with coeliac disease will have no routine laboratory abnormalities.Anti-endomysial antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies may be detected in coeliac disease. [12]  Small bowel biopsy will be abnormal with partial villous atrophy in coeliac disease.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Colon cancer can sometimes cause a change in bowel habits with either constipation or more frequent, smaller calibre stools. Some, but not all, colon cancer patients will have blood in their stool, and a rectal cancer may be palpable on rectal examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: iron-deficiency anaemia may be present.Endoscopy: will demonstrate malignant growth; colon cancer can be diagnosed by colonoscopy, whereas cancers of the rectum, sigmoid, and lower descending colon can be seen with flexible sigmoidoscopy.Barium enema: although less sensitive than endoscopy, many colon cancers can be seen on air-contrast barium enema.CT colography is accurate for colon neoplasms but is not yet widely available.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most bacterial and viral infections in immunocompetent patients are acute. The parasite Giardia lamblia can be associated with diarrhoea, nausea, and bloating.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool examination for ova and parasites can be used for screening. Multiple stools should be examined.Serum Giardia antigen is accurate for diagnosing Giardia lamblia.</p>",
