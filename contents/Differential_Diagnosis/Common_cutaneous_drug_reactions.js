"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> SLE usually occurs in young women; drug-induced lupus can occur in anyone.SLE commonly involves the kidneys, drug-induced lupus rarely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; rarely pancytopenia. (Drugs and infections should be excluded as a cause.)Serum complement: often low.SLE is associated with antibodies to double-stranded DNA; drug-induced lupus is associated with antibodies to single-stranded DNA.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents as erythematous, circumscribed, scaly papules and plaques on elbows, knees, extensor surfaces of limbs, and the scalp.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows that psoriasiform lesions caused by practolol are accompanied by fibrosis, which is not normally a feature of psoriasis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cutaneous lichen planus typically presents with intensely pruritic lesions on flexor wrists, ankles, trunk, and extremities.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy of lesional skin for histopathology shows lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and necrotic keratinocytes with hyperorthokeratosis and hypergranulosis in non-drug-induced lichen planus.In lichen planus, parakeratosis, spongiosis, and patchy inflammatory changes suggest a drug-induced cause.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differential diagnosis of any drug-related rash is the non-drug-related form of the condition that it looks like; in a few cases, such as SLE, psoriasis, and lichen planus, features help to distinguish drug-related from non-drug-related rashes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peripheral blood eosinophilia and an eosinophilic cellular infiltrate in any lesion suggest a drug-related effect.Exanthematous reactions are often due to infections; a specific diagnosis may be possible if the causative organism can be identified.</p>",
