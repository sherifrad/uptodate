"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Episodic tension-type headaches are usually bilateral, last from 30 minutes to 7 days, have a pressing or tightening quality, and are not aggravated by physical activity.Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia are not typical accompaniments.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Headaches following a well-defined concussive head injury are not unusual, and are likely to remit over a period of a few days or some weeks.There should have been a notable injury that predated the onset of headaches.A small traumatic extradural haematoma may manifest as persisting headache and vomiting post-injury without other clinical signs.The presence of HTN, bradycardia, altered consciousness level, or any focal neurological deficit suggests a more serious injury or alternative diagnosis and is an indication for urgent CNS imaging. [25]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT brain: in the absence of a focal neurological deficit, HTN, bradycardia, or altered consciousness level, CT is likely to be normal.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Less than 1% of children with headache have a brain tumour. Nocturnal or early-morning headaches may be indicative of elevated intracranial pressure secondary to a space-occupying lesion such as a tumour.Altered consciousness level, seizures, inappropriate behaviour (especially if recent onset), increasing head circumference, 'sun-setting eyes', prominent scalp veins, papilloedema, ophthalmoplegia, HTN with or without bradycardia, cranial nerve palsies, motor deficits, and cerebellar signs all suggest a more sinister CNS disorder: for example, tumour, [26]  encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, vasculitis/malformation, venous sinus thrombosis, and degenerative disorder.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In children &lt;4 years of age with headaches, neuroimaging should be given strong consideration to exclude a space-occupying lesion.CT/MRI brain and lumbar puncture are normal in migraine and (when indicated) will usually confirm the presence of an alternative pathology.</p>",
