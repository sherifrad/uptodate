"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No symptoms or signs reliably distinguish haemorrhagic stroke from ischaemic stroke.Haemorrhagic stroke is more often associated with reduced level of consciousness and signs of increased intracranial pressure than ischaemic stroke.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT or MRI demonstrates haemorrhage (hyperattenuation).</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Transient neurological symptoms last less than 24 hours, with no evidence of acute infarct.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The combination of headache, cognitive abnormalities or decreased level of consciousness, and HTN significantly above patient's baseline BP indicates hypertensive encephalopathy. Other possible signs/symptoms include visual changes or loss, or signs of increased intracranial pressure. [42]",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Repetitive history of similar events; preceding aura, headache in a marching pattern differentiates complicated migraine. [42]Stroke often presents with negative symptoms (e.g., visual loss, numbness, or weakness).Positive symptoms (e.g., marching paraesthesias, visual hallucinations, and abnormal motor manifestations) are more likely with complicated migraine.",

[42]Wrong-way eye deviation (i.e., gaze deviation away from the side of the brain lesion, towards the hemiparetic side) should prompt consideration of seizure but can also occur with strokes affecting the pons or thalamus.",
