"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History generally reveals bilateral ocular burning, itching, foreign body sensation, photophobia, crusting on the eyelids, and redness of lid margins. In severe cases, corneal changes can occur, leading to reduced vision.With associated dry eye syndrome, patients may report sensation of eye dryness.With associated acne rosacea, facial erythema, facial telangiectasia, papules, and pustules are seen.With associated seborrhoeic dermatitis, flaking and greasy skin on the scalp, retro-auricular area, glabella, and nasolabial folds is typical.Chalazion may be associated with underlying blepharitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Slit lamp examination is required to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other causes.In atypical unilateral cases, lid biopsy may be warranted to exclude other disorders, in particular malignancies such as basal cell, squamous cell, or sebaceous cell carcinoma.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Obstruction and bacterial infection of the lacrimal sac; easily identifiable on examination as a very tender, swollen, and fluctuant mass below the medial epicanthus.
