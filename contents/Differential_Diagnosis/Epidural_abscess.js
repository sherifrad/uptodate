"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Spontaneous spinal haematoma is rare, with an annual incidence of about 1 person per 1 million population. Rarely presents with fever, but pain and neurological signs are common. Related to the fragility of the epidural venous plexus, spinal epidural haematoma is seen more often after minor trauma and in males.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI shows low signal on T1 and bright on T2, with a few areas of T1 hyperintensity mixed within in the early phase. The lesion can be isointense to adjacent cord immediately after onset.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Variable presentation with multiple episodes. Can present with sudden neurological deficit, but rarely with fever or back pain. Common symptoms include progressive limb weakness, gait difficulty, ataxia, loss of balance, and paroxysmal vertigo.In the setting of acute paraparesis, visual symptoms (visual loss) may be present (neuromyelitis optica [NMO]). Patients may have optic disc atrophy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain MRI typically shows areas of demyelination.CSF examination may show raised IgG and oligoclonal banding.Visual evoked potentials are most commonly abnormal, with somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials less so.Patients with NMO may show NMO-IgG seropositivity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically present with chronic back pain and sometimes only leg pain. Neurological deficit is absent.",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar (with meningismus, malaise, and fever) but with less focal pain or spasm, and few radicular signs. Patients typically have moderate encephalopathy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging is negative for focal collections; may show diffuse dural enhancement. [28]</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Interval from pain onset to paralysis is often 1 day or less. Most patients are afebrile.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF analysis shows pleocytosis with a few lymphocytes and increased total protein.Imaging is often negative in early stage or may show focal cord T2 signal change without enhancement at the appropriate level.</p>",
