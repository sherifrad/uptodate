"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> UC presents with features of colitis including left-sided abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea.Does not involve small bowel or have oral or perianal disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy differentiates most cases of CD from UC. UC always involves the rectum and is contiguous versus intermittent. Terminal ileitis may be present in UC with pancolitis due to backwash. P-ANCA are positive in UC in 60% to 80% of the cases, whereas ASCA are positive in 40% to 50% of CD cases. [45]  [46]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of recent antibiotic use.Caution should be taken in differentiating the 2 conditions as Clostridium difficile infection can cause flare-up of CD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In the proper clinical setting, a positive test for C difficile toxin is diagnostic of pseudomembranous colitis.Colonoscopy shows pseudomembranes on top of the mucosa, with no ulceration of the underlying tissue.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Physical findings in ischaemic colitis usually do not correlate with the severity of pain.Most patients have risk factors such as atherosclerotic diseases or hypoperfusional states (such as CHF and hypotension).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy shows mucosal friability in the watershed areas of the left colon.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of exposure to external beam radiotherapy.Symptoms include abdominal pain, tenesmus, and chronic bleeding.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy reveals mucosal inflammation that resembles UC with friable, left-sided fibrotic and ulcerative lesions that are continuous. Many patients have bleeding angioectatic vessels.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Yersinia can cause an acute ileitis with a clinical picture resembling acute flare-up of CD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopic findings in Y enterocolitica enterocolitis include involvement of the terminal ileum in almost all patients and, less commonly, the ileocaecal valve, caecum, and the ascending colon. Small, rounded, or oval mucosal elevations with or without small ulcers in the terminal ileum are suggestive of Y enterocolitica enterocolitis.Stool cultures and serological tests confirm the diagnosis.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Immunocompromised patients, including those who have received solid organ transplant, patients on long-term immunosuppressants, or patients with HIV infection / AIDS.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy should be sent for histological examination, antigen detection, and viral culture. Classic histological findings include giant cells with cytomegaly and large ovoid or pleomorphic nuclei containing basophilic inclusions.</p>",

"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> All acute presentations with abdominal pain in women of childbearing age should be considered to be due to an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.May be a history of amenorrhoea, known positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine and or serum beta hCG positive.Pelvic ultrasound may identify a tubal pregnancy.If rupture is suspected and the patient is haemodynamically unstable, urgent resuscitation and surgery is required.</p>",

"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Chronic change in stool frequency, form, or appearance. Commonly associated with abdominal bloating and passing mucus per rectum.Spasmodic abdominal pain is often relived by defecation.CD should be suspected if symptoms are progressive or include bloody or nocturnal diarrhoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Screening blood tests show no evidence of inflammation.Biopsy does not show typical features of CD.Faecal calprotectin may have a future role as a screening tool; when elevated may help to distinguish a higher-risk group of patients who should be referred for endoscopic evaluation.
