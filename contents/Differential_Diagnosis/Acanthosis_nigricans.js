"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents in children on the neck, torso, and extremities rather than the flexural and intertriginous areas typically involved by AN. [6]  Lesions may be linear or verrucous in appearance.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows variable degrees of epidermal hyperplasia, papillomatosis, and inflammation.Some cases may show features indistinguishable from AN, but there is typically less papillomatosis and more inflammation than seen in AN. [6]As some authors consider AN a type of epidermal nevus, the distinction may be academic in some cases. [4]  [6]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows filiform downgrowths of epidermis with pigmented rete ridges and occasional pseudohorn cysts, resembling seborrhoeic keratosis.Papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis resembling AN are not seen. [26]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common lesions of adults that usually present as one or a few well-defined pigmented papules on the chest, back, and face.Most lesions are small, although rare plaque-like lesions have been reported on the buttocks or thighs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows epidermal acanthosis with pseudohorn cysts and variable papillomatosis. The lesions are usually more endophytic than AN, and the papillomatosis is more irregular.There is often inflammation and associated squamous differentiation with eddies, findings not seen in AN.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows epidermotropism by enlarged, atypical lymphocytes, often with nuclear hyperchromasia and hyperconvolutions.Immunohistochemistry shows an increased CD4:CD8 ratio in most cases. Molecular analysis shows clonal T-cell gene re-arrangement. [28]</p>",
