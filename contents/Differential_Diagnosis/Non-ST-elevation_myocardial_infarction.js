"<dt><a href='#Section0'>Aortic dissection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is described as a 'tearing' back pain. There may be BP differential between upper and lower extremities.Aortic dissection often occurs in patients who have collagen vascular disease (i.e., Marfan's syndrome).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest CT with contrast or MRI may show the dissection or an intimal flap. CXR may reveal widened mediastinum.Echocardiography may show a dissection depending on the location.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients often present with dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, or haemoptysis. Hypoxia may be present. Lower limbs should be examined for DVT (enlarged, tender, erythematous calves).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nuclear imaging with V/Q scans or chest CT with contrast is most often used to diagnose pulmonary embolism. High-probability V/Q scan findings are &ge;2 segmental or 1 larger perfusion defect with a normal CXR.Chest CT scan may show central filling defects within the vascular lumen, tracking of contrast material around a filling defect, and/or complete occlusion. Smooth filling defects making an obtuse angle with a vessel wall may represent chronic thrombi or recent recanalisation.Pulmonary artery angiography is the diagnostic standard. Positive findings include a filling defect or sharp cut-off of the artery. A tram-track appearance is described in the presence of non-occlusive emboli.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is described as burning epigastric pain that occurs hours after meals or with hunger. It often wakes the patient at night and is relieved by food and antacids.There may be a previous history of reflux or medicines that can cause peptic ulcer (i.e., recent use of steroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Endoscopy may show ulcers, erosion, or gastropathy.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Acute pericarditis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is relieved by sitting forwards. Friction rub or distant heart sounds may be heard on auscultation.A history of a recent cardiac procedure (Dressler's syndrome), renal failure, or preceding illness (fever or diarrhoea) may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG may show diffuse ST elevations.Echocardiogram and chest CT scan may show pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI is useful and has high sensitivity for detection of pericardial effusion, loculations, and pericardial thickening.Blood tests may indicate systemic inflammation (e.g., elevated WBC count, elevated ESR or CRP). Renal failure can cause uraemic pericarditis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Oesophageal spasm</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually diagnosed after ruling out other causes of chest pain. A past history of oesophageal spasm is typical and there may be a precipitating event.Pain due to oesophageal spasm is often relieved by glyceryl trinitrate, making it difficult to differentiate from cardiac pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The oesophagus may have a corkscrew appearance on barium swallow. This represents simultaneous rings of contraction in the distal oesophagus. [43]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Costochondritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Diagnosis is made on the history or exclusion of other causes. There may be a history of recent or repeated trauma. The pain is typically localised with point tenderness, sharp in nature, and relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There are no specific studies or imaging to diagnose costochondritis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Panic attack</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most often diagnosed after exclusion of other causes. Patients often have other psychiatric illness. Women are affected more than men. Panic attacks may be situational.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No tests or procedures can diagnose anxiety disorders.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Stable ischaemic heart disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Angina pain is recurrent and reproducible with exertion, and is relieved by rest or glyceryl trinitrate.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is most often made on history alone. Coronary artery catheterisation may show the typical fixed coronary artery luminal wall narrowing.Intravascular ultrasound during cardiac catheterisation may reveal the typical stable plaque of stable angina (calcified, thick fibrous caps) rather than the unstable plaques (lipid-laden, thin caps) that cause acute coronary syndrome.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Myocarditis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is a wide spectrum of presentation from asymptomatic to cardiogenic shock. Patients may present with a history of recent influenza-like illness associated with arthralgias and malaise. The symptoms of heart failure may be present.Myocarditis may be idiopathic or caused by infections (viral, bacterial, or fungal), drugs (e.g., chemotherapy agents, anti-hypertensives, and anti-epileptics), and autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The definitive test is endomyocardial biopsy, which shows lymphocyte infiltration and myocyte necrosis.Cardiac enzymes or brain natriuretic protein may be raised.Leukocytosis, eosinophilia, elevated ESR and CRP, and a rise in serum viral titres are common.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Acute cholecystitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> On physical examination there is constant RUQ pain with or without Murphy's sign (inhibition of inspiration due to pain on palpation). There may be a history of gallstones or previous episodes of biliary colic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound may show a distended gallbladder and gallstones. [44]  If ECG changes accompany cholecystitis, these would most likely include ST elevation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Boerhaave's syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Caused by oesophageal rupture with mediastinitis. It typically follows retching or vomiting, aggravated by swallowing. Patients may have subcutaneous emphysema and a hoarse voice.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR shows pneumomediastinum &gt;90% of the time. Oesophagram and CT scan can confirm diagnosis or reveal the condition. CT may show pneumomediastinum and peri-oesophageal air tracks. Oesophagram may show an oesophageal tear. [45]  Endoscopy is not recommended for Boerhaave's syndrome.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Brugada's syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More common in Asian people and men aged 30 to 50 years. Patients typically present after an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or a cardiac arrest.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG shows saddle-shaped ST elevation in leads V1 through V3. These changes are associated with complete or incomplete right bundle-branch block and T-wave inversions.</p>",
