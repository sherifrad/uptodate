"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Historically, it is difficult to distinguish ovarian cancer from IBS.Physical examination revealing a pelvic mass should cause suspicion for a non-GI process.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> As there is no disease biomarker for IBS, diagnosis is made with the Rome criteria, defined as at least 3 months of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with bowel movements; altered stool frequency, form, or passage; passage of mucus; and bloating.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Metastases to the ovary</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Over 50% of metastases to the ovary are from the GI tract (Krukenberg tumours). Approximately 4% of women with GI malignancies have metastasis to the ovary. Breast cancer is another malignancy that can metastasise to the ovary. In general, metastasis to the ovaries tends to be solid and is not associated with ascites. [32]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging may not differentiate between primary organ sites.Colonoscopy and/or upper endoscopy may be used to diagnose cancer originating in the GI tract.Additional tumour markers (CEA, CA 19-9, CA 27-29) should be considered as clinically indicated.Histopathology is usually the distinguishing test.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Endometriosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Endometriosis occurs in pre-menopausal women, as opposed to ovarian cancer, which occurs in older patients.Pelvic pain is a common symptom for both ovarian cancer and endometriosis, and thus is not helpful in distinguishing the 2 conditions.Approximately 50% of clear cell ovarian carcinomas are associated with endometriosis. The exact nature of this relationship is unclear. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of endometriosis, as for epithelial ovarian cancer, is histopathology.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be asymptomatic, and the process is noted as an incidental finding on colonoscopy or barium enema.An acute episode of diverticulitis can be associated with fever, leukocytosis, and left lower quadrant pain. [33]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Barium enema or colonoscopy can be used to diagnose diverticular disease.When active inflammation is present, a CT scan can demonstrate inflammation (seen as stranding) in the sigmoid colon.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Meigs' syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mainly seen in older women, the triad of ascites, hydrothorax, and a benign ovarian tumour comprises Meigs' syndrome.Signs and symptoms include tachypnoea, tachycardia, and decreased breath sounds usually on the right side.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Investigations may reveal a pelvic mass, electrolyte abnormalities, prolonged prothrombin time, and sometimes elevated CA-125.Chest x-ray confirms pleural effusion, with the U/S or CT showing a mass without metastasis.Thoracentesis and paracentesis are negative for malignant cells.</p>",
