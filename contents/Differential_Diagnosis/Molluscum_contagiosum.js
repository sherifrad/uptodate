"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> All warts have abnormal skin markings or dermatoglyphics. Verrucous papules and plaques typify most warts, the sole being the most common location. Some warts are filiform coming to a point, and on the genitalia condyloma, are usually flat plaques.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Paring warts reveals pinpoint bleeding. Biopsy specimens demonstrate verrucous hyperkeratotic skin lesions as opposed to Henderson-Patterson bodies seen in molluscum.Immunoperoxidase staining or in situ PCR can be done to identify human papillomavirus subtypes, which are the molecular confirmation techniques for warts.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with Cryptococcosis and Penicillium marneffei infection are very ill, usually immunosuppressed, with fever and systemic symptoms including CNS changes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Fungal smears, cultures and latex agglutinin tests from lesions, spinal taps and blood will demonstrate fungal elements. A skin biopsy stained with fungal stains will demonstrate spores.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> While these lesions are small papules with central orifices, they tend to be smaller than and not as pearly as molluscum. Milia typically occur over the cheeks, whereas molluscum is seen in the axilla or groin more commonly.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy can differentiate these two, but as both conditions are benign, it is rarely needed.</p>",
