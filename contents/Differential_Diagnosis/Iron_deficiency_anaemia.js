"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> On FBC, in 80% of cases, anaemia of chronic disease is normocytic and normochromic. However, in 20% of cases it can present as a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia much like IDA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC and peripheral smear: anaemia, hypochromia, microcytosis, anisocytosis, and poikilocytosis are less pronounced than in IDA.Ferritin is often elevated in patients with anaemia of chronic disease. [37]Anaemia of chronic disease has a normal transferrin receptor assay. [37]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Disorders of globin synthesis (thalassaemias, haemoglobin E, haemoglobin C, unstable haemoglobins)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is a potpourri of disorders and often requires a haematologist to sort them out. Patients with severe thalassaemia are usually transfusion dependent from childhood and therefore diagnosed early. Patients with thalassaemia minor may not be diagnosed until adulthood.Haemoglobin electrophoresis may help distinguish these disorders but can be normal.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: often more severe microcytosis than expected for the degree of anaemia. Haemoglobin will never be normal. In thalassaemia, red cell distribution width is usually normal.Peripheral smear: more pronounced basophilic stippling and target cells.Haemoglobin electrophoresis: raised Hb A2 level is a common beta-thalassaemia trait.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Disorders of porphyrin and haem synthesis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is a collection of disorders characterised by defective synthesis of porphyrin and haem. An enzymatic defect leads to an accumulation of the substrate in the red cells and plasma and is therefore excreted in the urine and/or stool.Some of these disorders are accompanied by neurological disorders and/or photosensitivity. They often have a positive family history.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Testing for most of these disorders is not readily available and requires referral to a haematologist and possible research centres.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Sideroblastic anaemias</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Alcoholism can be a cause of a reversible sideroblastic anaemia. Hepatosplenomegaly is found in one third to one half of patients with sideroblastic anaemia and is not present in IDA. [15]Peripheral smear and bone marrow biopsy can help distinguish this from IDA, although erythrocyte dimorphism is also seen in partially treated IDA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peripheral smear: erythrocyte dimorphism (hypochromic, microcytic population mixed with normal population).Presence of the occasional heavily stippled, hypochromic cell. [15]Bone marrow biopsy: ringed sideroblasts seen because of accumulation of iron in the mitochondria.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Lead intoxication</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may have a history of risk factors for lead exposure such as occupational exposures (exposure to lead paint) or distillation of moonshine alcohol.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lead level and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) or zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) can be tested. Lead level is increased. Increased FEP or ZPP can reflect exposure to lead in previous 3 months (the typical life span of a red cell).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Atransferrinaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This very rare disorder is characterised by low plasma iron concentration secondary to a lack of transferrin, which normally acts as a specific iron transport protein.Transferrin can be given to correct the disorder. [15]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum and bone marrow iron levels: low as they are in IDA, but, unlike in IDA, total iron-binding capacity will also be low. [15]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Antibodies against the transferrin receptor</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is very rare and only reported as case reports. Clinically these patients would resemble patients with IDA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: hypochromic, microcytic anaemia.Bone marrow biopsy: devoid of iron.Iron profile: increased serum iron concentration, normal serum ferritin level.FEP: dramatically increased. [15]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Aluminium intoxication</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This occurs primarily in haemodialysis patients if the public water supply is used as a source of water for dialysis. This can be avoided with the use of deionised water and can be reversed with the use of a deferoxamine chelator. [15]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Erythrocyte aluminium levels would be increased. [15]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients will often have neurological abnormalities. [50]",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Gallium administration</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Gallium binds to transferrin and inhibits cellular iron uptake. Patients would have a history of gallium infusion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microcytic hypochromic anaemia was noted in patients treated with gallium in a phase II chemotherapy trial. [15]</p>",
