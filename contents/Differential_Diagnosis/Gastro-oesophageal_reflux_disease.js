"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No reliable differentiating signs or symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Functional heartburn denotes endoscopy-negative heartburn by definition. A normal oesophageal pH study differentiates between non-erosive GORD and functional heartburn. An alternative is a normal impedance-pH study. These studies would usually be done in patients who fail to respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Endoscopy may show oesophageal rings, linear furrows, white plaques, exudates, absence of a hiatus hernia, and a narrow-calibre oesophagus. [29]  [30]Maximum peripheral eosinophil count may be higher than typical for GORD. [30]Eosinophil count may be &ge;15 per high power field in sampled oesophageal tissue.
