"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most frequently occurs in early childhood.Macules, which develop into vesicles and form golden-yellow crusts.Most often affects exposed areas on face, hands and extremities.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy: subcorneal pustules filled with neutrophils and occasional acantholytic cells. Sometimes Gram-positive cocci may be identified in the pustule or on the surface of the crusts. The dermal infiltrate usually contains perivascular lymphocytes and neutrophils. [18]  [19]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy of bullous pemphigoid will show a sub-epidermal bulla with a predominantly eosinophilic infiltrate on H&amp;E stain, and direct immunofluorescence of peri-lesional skin will show linear IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction. [21]</p>",
