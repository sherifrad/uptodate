"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine ketones are often present in type 1 diabetes, but may be positive in type 2 diabetes if there is severe volume depletion.Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, islet cell antibodies, and insulin autoantibodies are present in 85% of patients with type 1 at the time of diagnosis, but may disappear within a few years. Usually not required for diagnosis.Glucose criteria cannot be used to differentiate type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as they are identical.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This only occurs during pregnancy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Gestational diabetes is detected by screening during pregnancy.The 2011 American Diabetes Association recommendations, [2]  based on the HAPO study, [20]  are now to test all women not previously known to have diabetes using the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, and using diagnostic cut points of ONE or more abnormalities: fasting &ge;5.1 mmol/L (&ge;92 mg/dL); 1-hour &ge;10.0 mmol/L (&ge;180 mg/dL); or 2-hour &ge;8.5 mmol/L (&ge;153 mg/dL).This change in screening test will likely increase the prevalence of gestational diabetes from about 8% to about 18% to 20% of pregnancies in the US. The new guidelines also call for testing all pregnant women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes at the first neonatal visit, although a diagnosis at this stage would be considered a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and not gestational diabetes.
