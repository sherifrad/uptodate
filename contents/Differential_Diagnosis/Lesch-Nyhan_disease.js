"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Owing to the occurrence of hypotonia and developmental delay early in the course of the disease, many patients are diagnosed as having cerebral palsy until the tell-tale features of LND, such as self-injury or overproduction of uric acid, are recognised.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Self-injury in LND is usually more severe than in other conditions, and the prominent topographical preference for fingers is not frequently seen in other conditions. View imageSelf-injurious behaviour in LND is always accompanied by profound motor impairment. LND should be suspected when self-injurious behaviour is associated with the typical motor dysfunction emerging early in life, especially if there is also hyperuricaemia.",
