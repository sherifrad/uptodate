"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The clinical presentation may appear similar to non-HIV-related infections of P jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), M tuberculosis (MTB), CMV, or even community-acquired pneumonia. The clinical history (including degree of immunosuppression), physical findings, presence of extra-pulmonary disease, may help in the diagnosis of the underlying cause.Bacterial pneumonia is the most common HIV-associated opportunistic pneumonia in the US and has replaced PCP as the most frequently encountered opportunistic respiratory infection. Worldwide, TB dominates the clinical picture. [140]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The nature and distribution of pulmonary findings on the chest x-ray, CD4 count, sputum Gram stain and culture, and chest CT may be required for definitive diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common presentation in HIV-infected patients with enterocolitis caused by bacteria, including MTB and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), parasites, or CMV. The clinical history including degree of immunosuppression, nature and duration of symptoms, concomitant medicines, travel, and other exposures may help to differentiate the underlying cause.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CD4 count, stool leukocyte examination, stool culture for enteric bacterial pathogens, ova, and parasites; Clostridium difficile toxin assay; stool examination at least 3 times with modified acid-fast stain (Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Isospora).Endoscopic evaluation with biopsy.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, mycobacterial infection (especially TB), and progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy are the most common OIs involving the CNS. The degree of immunosuppression, the presence of seizures, headache, focal versus non-focal process, and disturbance of cognitive function may be helpful.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CD4 count, CSF opening pressure and analysis including cell count, India ink, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stains; CSF PCR, cryptococcal antigen in the CSF and serum; brain CT and MRI.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Hepatitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Viral hepatitis (HAV, HBV, HCV), MAC, TB, cryptococcus, toxoplasma, may have similar clinical presentation. The clinical history including degree of immunosuppression may help to differentiate the underlying cause.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Hepatitis serologies, alk phos levels, blood culture for acid-fast bacilli, liver biopsy.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The clinical presentation may appear similar to candidiasis, herpes simplex virus, CMV, idiopathic oesophageal ulcers, and less commonly MAC and TB. The clinical history (including degree of immunosuppression), inspection of the oropharynx (thrush, ulcers) may be helpful.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Endoscopic evaluation with mucosal biopsy; CD4 count.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Causes in HIV-infected people include CMV, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, or varicella-zoster virus. The clinical history (including degree of immunosuppression), physical findings, including extra-ocular disease, may be helpful.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ophthalmological (fundoscopic examination), CD4 count.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Fever of unknown origin</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> TB and MAC, CMV, lymphomas, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis often present with fever. History should be thorough, including travel and exposures. Physical examination with emphasis on oral cavity, skin, sinuses, eyes, lungs, lymph nodes, and peri-anal area.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood and lymphocyte count; blood cultures for acid-fast bacilli; serological tests; chest x-ray; stool examination; biopsies of lung, bone marrow, and liver for cultures and cytological tests; brain imaging (CT or MRI).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Lymphadenopathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Primary HIV infection, mycobacterial diseases including TB and MAC, herpes, CMV, cryptococcus, syphilis, toxoplasma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can cause generalised lymphadenopathy. Exposures, travel history, medicines, degree of immunodeficiency, and constitutional symptoms are important. The location, size, consistency, fixation (or not), tenderness of lymph nodes, and splenomegaly can help.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC, chest x-ray, lymph node biopsy for cultures and cytological tests, blood cultures including for acid-fast bacilli.</p>",
