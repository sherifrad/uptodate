"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More common than toxic MNG and occurs in generally younger age group.Auto-immune features, such as exophthalmos or pretibial myxoedema, may be present.Goitre is diffuse rather than nodular. However, long-standing Graves' disease may mimic toxic multi-nodular goitre (MNG).Symptoms of hyperthyroidism are generally more marked than for toxic MNG.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thyroid scan shows diffuse rather than variegated appearance. Uptake is high.Free thyroid hormone levels are usually higher than for toxic MNG.Often there is evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (i.e., positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies), although this is not diagnostic.When positive, TSH receptor antibodies are diagnostic, but these are rarely required.</p>",
