"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can be caused by several different processes; therefore, a history of infection, pulmonary infarcts, drug reactions, collagen vascular diseases, trauma, or surgery may be present. [24]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pleural biopsy is necessary to distinguish benign mesothelial hyperplasia from malignant pleural mesothelioma; invasion of underlying tissues favours mesothelioma. [24]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Exposure to asbestos can cause several benign pleural reactions, including pleural effusion, pleural plaques, diffuse pleural fibrosis, and rounded atelectasis. [6]  Differentiating these processes from malignant pleural mesothelioma can be difficult.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pleural plaques are frequently documented on plain chest x-ray, but CT is more sensitive for their detection. Slow progression of plaques is typical. The presence of plaques is associated with a greater risk of mesothelioma, but this is thought to be related to greater exposure or retained body burden, not malignant degeneration. [25]Findings on chest CT scan (serial studies usually necessary) suggesting a malignant process include circumferential or nodular pleural thickening, involvement of the mediastinal pleura, or enlarged regional lymph nodes.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest CT scan shows size, location, and extent of primary tumour; evaluates for hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and distant metastases.Sputum cytology shows characteristic malignant cells. Specificity greater than 95%, sensitivity variable between 20% and 70%. More likely to be positive with central lesions compared with peripheral lesions.Flexible bronchoscopy plus biopsy provides pathological confirmation of diagnosis.</p>",
