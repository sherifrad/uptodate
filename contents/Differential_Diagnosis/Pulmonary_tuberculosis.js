"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs of lobar or atypical pneumonia including crackles and dyspnoea. Generally, shorter duration of symptoms compared with TB. If there is doubt, consider treating for bacterial pneumonia first (without using fluoroquinolones or other antibiotics with significant antituberculous activity) and assess for response.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum examination with presence of bacteria other than normal flora.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> TB and lung cancer may co-exist; malignancy may erode granulomas. Despite acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum, if features suggest cancer (e.g., irregular cavities) or lung abnormalities progress in patients on antituberculous treatment, further evaluation for cancer should be pursued. [34]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mycobacterium avian complex and M. kansasii may both present as cavitary lesions. Patient risk factors for TB may point to most likely diagnosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If sputum AFB culture is positive, DNA probe may be used for species identification. Similarly a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) that is negative for TB on a smear-positive sputum (95% sensitivity) makes M. tuberculosis less likely. NTM is more common in patients with underlying lung disease.</p>",
