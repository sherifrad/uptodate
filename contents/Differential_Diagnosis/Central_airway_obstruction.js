"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dyspnoea is not progressive and wheeze is bilateral. Symptoms of dyspnoea, wheeze, and stridor are responsive to pharmacological therapy (e.g., bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary function tests: airflow obstruction with a reduced FEV1 and FEV1 to FVC ratio; lung volumes show different degrees of hyperinflation and air trapping depending on severity; the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may be reduced.CXR: flattened diaphragms and hyperinflation.HRCT chest: areas of lung destruction, consistent with emphysematous change.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> It should be noted that not all conditions associated with wheeze are asthma.Dyspnoea is episodic and not progressive, and wheeze is bilateral. Symptoms of dyspnoea and wheeze are responsive to pharmacological therapy (e.g., bronchodilators, corticosteroids).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary function tests: during exacerbations, the FEV1 and FEV1 to FVC ratio will be reduced, the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may be elevated.Bronchodilator reversibility test: shows improvement following administration of bronchodilators.Methacholine challenge: positive.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms of pyrexia, rigors, and cough productive of purulent sputum are characteristic.Non-resolving or post-obstructive pneumonia related to CAO will not adequately respond clinically and radiographically to antibiotic therapy, and patients may experience persistent symptoms and CXR signs of infiltrates for &gt;4 to 6 weeks.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: radiologically evident infiltrates that may be unilobar or multilobar.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The presentation of VCD may be quite dramatic, often simulating either CAO related to foreign-body aspiration or a severe asthma attack.The clinical scenario and past medical history aid diagnosis.Patients with VCD are often able to complete full sentences and can hold their breath, and the sounds of the attack disappear during a panting manoeuvre. [13]  [28]On auscultation, the sounds in VCD are louder over the neck than in the chest.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary function tests: the flow-volume loop (FVL) shows a pattern of variable extrathoracic upper airway obstruction, 'sawtoothing' or fluttering on the inspiratory limb which represents fluctuations in the abnormal vocal cord motion may be evident, and the FVL shows significant variability from test to test and may be normal in between attacks. [13]Laryngoscopy: allows direct visualisation of abnormal vocal cord motion. [13]</p>",
