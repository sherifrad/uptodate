"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by memory loss, reduced social and occupational functioning, diminished executive function, speech/motor deficits, personality change, and behavioural/psychological disturbance.Minimal fluctuations in level of consciousness.Cognitive exam shows short-term memory loss. Absence of significant extrapyramidal signs early in the disease.Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is not typically present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical history and examination are the best way to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from DLB.Neuropsychological testing may be helpful if there is a prominent amnestic syndrome early in the disease.Structural and functional imaging may also be of benefit.In Alzheimer's disease, there is decreased perfusion in temporoparietal regions with single-photon emission CT (SPECT)/positron emission tomography (PET).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Considerable overlap with DLB.Visual hallucinations, paranoia, and autonomic dysfunction are common features.Motor symptoms include rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Impulsive, socially inappropriate, and emotionally labile behaviour.Personality change and behavioural disturbance occur early and are prominent features.Verbal and language skills are blunted.Apathy and self-neglect are common.Onset often in 50s, progressing more rapidly than DLB.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT or brain MRI reveals structural atrophy in the frontal lobes.PET or SPECT scanning shows reduced brain activity in the frontal and temporal lobes.Brain histology may reveal diagnostic findings (such as Pick bodies).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Deficits include memory loss, emotional lability, and focal neurological deficits consistent with stroke location.Cardiovascular risk factors may be present.Further cognitive and functional decline occurs in a stepwise manner.Subcortical depression and apathy are common.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT or MRI scanning demonstrates areas of past infarction and perivascular ischaemia.</p>",
