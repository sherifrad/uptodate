"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A loculated haematoma can be very challenging to differentiate from an IAA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Haemoperitoneum is usually accompanied by a drop in haematocrit.Fluid sampling and culture is usually diagnostic. Measurement of fluid density by CT scan may be helpful.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually accompanied by a recent history of pancreatitis. A challenging part in the work-up of a pancreatic pseudocyst is the exclusion of an infection. High-grade fever is unlikely in pancreatitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Air-fluid level on CT scan will help identify an infected pancreatic pseudocyst. Fluid sampling usually confirms the diagnosis.Absence of debris on CT scan is helpful to exclude an abscess.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A phlegmon is an inflammatory mass with some associated exudates, and therefore not an actual abscess. Phlegmon may become an abscess if not treated. Both may have the same clinical picture.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sometimes very hard to differentiate from an abscess. CT scan may be helpful.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Other fluids that collect in the peritoneal cavity are lymph or serum (seroma). Sometimes very hard to differentiate from an abscess.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan may be helpful to evaluate the character of the fluid in the collection. Fluid sampling and culture is usually diagnostic.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Normal post-operative changes or post-operative fluid collections</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differentiation of an early IAA from normal post-operative changes and fluid collections can be challenging. Most post-operative fluid collections are not infected and resolve spontaneously. However, infected fluid collections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and require percutaneous or surgical drainage.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging features that indicate infection include the presence of gas where none was seen previously, the development of a discrete abscess wall, and rim-shaped enhancement in the abscess wall, with either single- or double-ring signs.</p>",
