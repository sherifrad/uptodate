"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Children with congenital superior oblique palsy, also known as ocular torticollis, tend to tilt their head away from the side of the weak superior oblique muscle to restore binocular vision. On examination, if the head is passively tilted toward the affected side, hypertropia or vertical deviation of the eye may be seen, but this is not always obvious. [3]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Children with congenital vertebral segmentation anomalies such as hemi-vertebrae or Klippel-Feil syndrome present with a head tilt and can have associated cervico-thoracic scoliosis. There may be more fixed deformities noted on physical examination.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cranial asymmetry resulting from craniosynostosis is not typical of that seen in congenital muscular torticollis with positional plagiocephaly. For example, posterior plagiocephaly produces a parallelogram-shaped head while unilateral lambdoid synostosis produces a trapezium-shaped head. [24]",
