"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of exposure to silica. In certain workplaces, such as foundries and mines, workers may be exposed to both silica and asbestos. [19]Similar clinical presentation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR of silicosis is very different, with small rounded opacities initially beginning in the upper lobes. With progression, these smaller nodules conglomerate into large opacities (progressive massive fibrosis). Unlike asbestos exposure, there are no pleural changes seen.Lung biopsy shows pathognomonic silicotic nodules. Some patients with exposure to asbestos and silica may have radiographical and/or pathological changes of mixed dust.</p>",
