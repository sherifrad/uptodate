"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hyperthyroidism has gradual onset and is mild in nodular disease. Toxic multinodular goitre usually occurs in an older age group.Nodular goitre is found on physical examination.Extrathyroidal manifestations, such as ophthalmopathy, dermopathy and acropachy are absent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peripheral thyroid hormone levels are not usually as high as in Graves' disease.Thyroid receptor antibodies are absent.Thyroid isotopic scan and thyroid ultrasound show nodular goitre.Radioactive iodine uptake is usually normal.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Transient hyperthyroid phase is mostly followed by transient hypothyroid phase. Fifty percent of patients will ultimately develop permanent hypothyroidism in the following years. [47]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Radioactive iodine uptake is very low and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are high.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Subacute (granulomatous or de Quervain) thyroiditis starts with thyroid pain and systemic febrile symptoms. Transient hyperthyroid phase followed by transient hypothyroid phase and resolution in few months is typical, with painful thyroid and systemic febrile symptoms. [48]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The patient may be clinically hypothyroid, euthyroid, or hyperthyroid depending on the type of resistance. Family history is mostly positive for the syndrome, but isolated cases have been reported.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thyroid hormone levels are elevated with inappropriately normal TSH. [46]Molecular genetic testing is diagnostic.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI or CT scan of orbit suggests a non-thyroidal diagnosis such as orbital myositis, neoplasm or cavernous sinus thrombosis. [1]  TFTs are normal. TSH receptor antibody activity is absent.</p>",
