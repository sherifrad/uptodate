"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> People suffering diabetic ketoacidosis and acidosis from other causes (e.g., aspirin toxicity) have laboured (Kussmaul) breathing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Arterial blood gas analysis shows metabolic acidosis (low pH, low bicarbonate) and hyperventilation (decreased PaCO2). Pulse oximetry shows normal oxygen saturation.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> People with acute panic attack and other forms of anxiety often present with marked respiratory distress characterised by 'air hunger' or a feeling of dyspnoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory alkalosis with an elevated pH and decreased PaCO2. Pulse oximetry shows normal oxygen saturation.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> During apnoeic spells, arterial blood gas analysis may show decreased PaO2 and elevated PaCO2 and pulse oximetry shows hypoxia. When awake and stimulated by daily routines, arterial blood gases are often normal. Sleep apnoea is diagnosed by a formal sleep study.</p>",
