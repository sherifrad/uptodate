"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Amenorrhoea with breast tenderness, fatigue, nausea, and an enlarging abdomen may be pregnancy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An hCG level (in urine samples) of &lt;5 IU/L (&lt;5 mIU/mL) is considered negative for pregnancy, and anything &gt;25 IU/L (&gt;25 mIU/mL) is considered positive for pregnancy. Every woman's level of hCG can rise differently. It is not necessarily the level that matters but rather the change in the level.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> With hypothyroidism, a woman may experience heavy bleeding and irregular periods. Other symptoms are fatigue, hair loss, dry skin, constipation, and weight gain, which may mimic menopausal symptoms.",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A patient with onset of anorexia later in life may also have amenorrhoea, vaginal dryness, and sleep disturbance but usually will also be underweight and may have electrolyte disturbance, anaemia, and bradycardia or other cardiac arrhythmias. Do not experience hot flushes. It is normally possible to differentiate an eating disorder from premature menopause by taking a careful history of eating habits and measuring FSH.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FSH levels will be low to normal (c.f., high in menopause). There may be electrolyte disturbance, anaemia, and bradycardia in severe cases of anorexia nervosa.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modifier previously used in patients with breast cancer to prevent recurrence, is notorious for causing hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Raloxifene, also a selective oestrogen receptor modifier, is used for preservation of bone density in post-menopausal women and also results in hot flushes. Niacin, which is prescribed to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, also can cause hot flushes. It is important to take a careful medication history, including herbals, which may affect pharmacokinetics of another medication",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Consider a trial of withholding the pertinent therapy if possible, to see if the hot flushes are primarily medication-induced.</p>",
