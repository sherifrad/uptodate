"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Primary or secondary tumours in bone, joints, involving nerves, tendons, the head and neck, major organs or soft tissues present with constitutional symptoms and proximal muscle pain. Paraneoplastic syndrome symptoms usually do not respond to analgesia or corticosteroid treatment. A thorough tumour work-up should be performed in patients who are unresponsive to first-line chronic pain treatment, as removal of the tumour may lead to a resolution of symptoms.The Lambert-Eaton syndrome, a paraneoplastic condition associated with small-cell lung cancer, may cause proximal muscle weakness. Cancer may also result in neural impingement, causing radiculopathy or myelopathy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tumour screening includes routine baseline tests including CXR, FBC, chemistry panel and urinalysis. Age-appropriate cancer screening tests should also be performed (i.e., fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy, mammogram). Additional specialised testing should be directed by the history, examination findings and abnormalities found on the routine CXR and laboratory tests. Sagittal MRI effectively identifies multi-level metastatic spinal disease. Other specific tests as directed by clinical evaluation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Hypothyroidism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May show signs of muscle and joint pain, weakness in the extremities and fatigue; however, delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is strongly suggestive of hypothyroidism.May mimic chronic pain syndromes, particularly fibromyalgia, which is often associated with change in weight and depression.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An elevated TSH, elevated T3 and T4, and elevated CK helps to differentiate hypothyroidism.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with history of neck, shoulder girdle and/or hip girdle stiffness and pain, occurring in patients more than 50 years of age, commonly female. Patients complain of difficulty rising from seated or prone positions, varying degrees of muscle tenderness, shoulder/hip bursitis and/or oligoarthritis. Rapid improvement is almost invariable within 24 to 48 hours with low-dose prednisolone. Fifteen percent to 20% of patients with PMR have giant cell arteritis (GCA); 40% to 60% of GCA patients have PMR.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis of PMR is made via history and with supportive laboratory tests indicating an elevated ESR or C-reactive protein.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Giant cell arteritis (GCA)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> New-onset unilateral headache, jaw claudication associated with chewing tough foods, diffuse mandibular discomfort, dental discomfort, sinus pain and pressure, and/or tongue pain are associated with GCA. Blindness, diplopia or blurry vision and an abnormally thickened, tender, erythematous or nodular temporal artery are also found. Patients more than 50 years old with new-onset headache should be screened for GCA or temporal arteritis. Fifteen percent to 20% of patients with PMR have GCA; 40% to 60% of GCA patients have PMR.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated ESR or C-reactive protein. A positive temporal artery biopsy showing a granulomatous vasculitis confirms the diagnosis of GCA. Diagnostic and therapeutic corticosteroid trial.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Polymyositis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symmetrical weakness of shoulder and pelvic girdles.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated muscle enzyme levels (e.g., CK) often with a positive ANA titre.Characteristic changes in EMG associated with polymyositis include increased needle insertional activity, spontaneous fibrillations, low-amplitude short-duration polyphasic motor potentials and complex repetitive discharges.Diagnosis is confirmed with muscle biopsy, indicating immune cell infiltration and destruction of muscle fibres.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Depression</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Depression is diagnosed clinically with a finding of more than 5 of the following symptoms, present during the same 2-week period: depressed mood, anhedonia, weight changes, libido changes, sleep disturbance, psychomotor problems, low energy, excessive guilt, poor concentration and suicidal ideation. Depression may be associated with degrees of anxiety disorder, which may be associated with muscular tension.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No differentiating tests.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Analgesic overuse</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical diagnosis may require medicine-use diaries and prescription refill records to identify overuse of medicines. Headache or pain pattern reassessed 1 month after analgesics discontinued or drug taper completed. Analgesic overuse may be associated with bilateral, constant headaches lasting 8 to 24 hours in patients taking analgesics, triptans, opioids, barbiturates or ergotamines.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No differentiating tests.</p>",
