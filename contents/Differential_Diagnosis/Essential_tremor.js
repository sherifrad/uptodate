"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Resting and action tremor, with rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Also, masked facies, cog-wheeling, gait abnormalities, and early morning dystonia. [10]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A dopaminergic agent (e.g., levodopa) trial can clarify the diagnosis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in patients &lt;40 years of age.Characterised by resting and action tremor.Other neurological abnormalities present (e.g., dystonia, dysarthria, depression, cognitive impairment). [10]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A low serum ceruloplasmin (&lt;200 mg/L [20 mg/dL]) would indicate that the patient had Wilson's disease. [4]Ophthalmological examination with a slit lamp reveals Kayser-Fleischer rings in most patients who have neurological signs.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> All normal, healthy individuals exhibit physiological tremor.It can be enhanced by intake of stimulants and other drugs, by withdrawal from drugs or alcohol, during certain medical conditions (elevated thyroid hormone levels or low glucose level), and by stress and fatigue. [4]Enhanced physiological tremor occurs in the absence of a neurological disease and is high-frequency postural and kinetic tremor that occurs in the arms, legs, and voice but not the head.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A medicine history looking for agents that cause enhanced physiological tremor, and TFTs screening for hyperthyroidism.In some patients, quantitative computerised tremor analysis with accelerometers attached to the arms can help in diagnosing enhanced physiological tremor. [38]It is usually reversible once the cause is corrected.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs following ingestion of certain drugs (e.g., lithium carbonate, theophylline valproic acid, ciclosporin [cyclosporine], caffeine).The tremor may affect the hands, arms, head, eyelids, or other muscles, but rarely affect the legs or feet.The shaking usually involves small, rapid movements, &gt;5 times a second.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The tremor will occur in a reasonable time frame following drug ingestion.</p>",
