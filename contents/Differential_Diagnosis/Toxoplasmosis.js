"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Prior history of residence in an endemic area (Central and South America). Acute infection is rarely symptomatic, but acute infection in the very young (&lt;2 years old) may present with encephalitis or focal brain lesions, often accompanied by myocarditis, and poses a high mortality risk. Chronic infections occasionally develop acute CNS involvement (encephalitis with necrotic brain lesions causing mass effect) in immunocompromised patients.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Demonstration of Trypanosoma cruzi in blood, tissue or CSF; PCR of tissue or body fluids; serological tests.</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most common CNS opportunistic infection in AIDS patients, presenting subacutely with encephalitis, retinitis, progressive myelitis or polyradiculitis. In disseminated disease, may also include liver test abnormalities or worsening renal function.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain CT/MRI/biopsy: location of lesions are usually near the brainstem or periventricular areas.PCR of CSF with detectable virus is diagnostic.Brain biopsy with + staining for CMV or evidence of owl's eyes is also diagnostic, but is rarely performed because of the location of brain lesions.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Seizures, headache, confusion and/or urinary retention can be seen in disseminated disease, which usually affects only immunocompromised or acute infections in pregnant women; may be associated with concurrent genital/oral lesions; can be spread to the neonate during acute infection in the mother, or via viral shedding in the birth canal. Neonatal HSV can range from localised skin infections to encephalitis, pneumonitis, and disseminated disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain CT/MRI/biopsy: location of lesions is usually the medial temporal lobe or the orbital surface of the frontal lobe.PCR of CSF with detectable virus is diagnostic.</p>",

"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Multifocal involvement has subacute course, usually only in immunosuppressed, with headache, fever, focal deficits, and seizures. Unifocal involvement is more typically seen in immunocompetent hosts, occurring after contralateral cranial nerve herpes zoster, with mental status changes, TIAs, and stroke. Disseminated varicella zoster virus can occur in adults during primary infection, presenting with pneumonitis and/or hepatitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Disease is usually a vasculopathy, with haemorrhage and stroke.PCR of CSF with detectable virus is diagnostic.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> PCR of CSF for JC virus.Biopsy reveals white matter lesions and not well-circumscribed lesions.</p>",
