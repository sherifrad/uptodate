"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of diabetes and hypoglycaemia are more common in older patients or those attempting tight control.Differentiating features include signs of autonomic overactivity, sweating, tachycardia, and coma. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be preceded by polyuria, nausea, and confusion. Patients may have fruity, acetone breath, tachycardia, and abdominal pain.Hyperglycaemia may occur in absence of ketones and may also cause metabolic encephalopathy.",
