"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often affects only 1 limb but can affect more. Recent chest pain suggesting a myocardial infarction.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In embolic disease, an echocardiogram may show a valve lesion or thrombus; ECG and troponin may show evidence of myocardial ischaemia.Echocardiogram, ECG, and troponin blood tests show no dysrhythmia and no evidence of recent myocardial infarction in Buerger's disease.Duplex imaging may reveal the embolised thrombus.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acronym for calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.Disease typically limited to distal upper and lower extremities; may involve face and neck.Oesophageal dysmotility produces dysphagia and GERD. Sclerodactyly produces bright shiny skin of hands and feet.Other features include dilated nailbed capillaries, symmetrical swelling of the fingers with reduced range of motion, contractures affecting joints in the hand, claw hand deformities, digital ulcers, and carpal tunnel syndrome.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anti-centromere antibody may be positive and is strongly suggestive of the disease.Serum anti-nuclear antibody may be positive but is not specific.Serum extractable nuclear antigens may be positive.CBC with peripheral fragmentation of red blood cells is associated with systemic disease.Serum creatinine elevated in presence of renal crisis.</p>",
