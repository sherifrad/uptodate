"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The pain of aortic dissection is typically severe, sudden in onset, and often described as tearing, sharp, or stabbing. The pain may be retrosternal, interscapular, abdominal, in the neck, lower back, or lower extremities. Hypertension is common with distal aortic dissections. Pulse deficits are common, particularly in proximal dissections. [50]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest radiograph may show a widened mediastinum, leading to initial suspicion.Contrast-enhanced CT or transoesophageal echocardiogram will demonstrate the presence of a true and false lumen with dissection flap. [50]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Pericarditis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The pain of acute pericarditis is typically severe, sudden in onset, and retrosternal or left precordial in location. The chest pain is often pleuritic, aggravated by supine positioning and relieved by sitting upright. A pericardial friction rub may be appreciated on examination. [51]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG will show diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression. [51]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dyspnoea is the most common symptom of acute pulmonary embolus. History may reveal symptoms of lower extremity venous thrombosis (erythema, warmth, pain, or swelling). Tachypnoea and tachycardia are the most common signs. [52]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> D-dimer: normal value is useful to rule out pulmonary embolism in patients with low clinical probability of pulmonary embolism. [52]An ECG is useful to exclude alternate diagnosis.Non-specific findings seen with pulmonary embolism include ST abnormalities, T-wave changes, and right or left axis deviation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Pneumothorax</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically, presents with acute chest pain, dyspnoea, and cough. Examination reveals decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance over the area of pneumothorax. [53]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The chest radiograph will show a visceral pleural line at the apex in an upright film; caution is advised in interpretation of supine films. [53]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Pneumonia with pleurisy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pleurisy results in localised chest pain that is worsened by deep breathing. [54]In the setting of pneumonia, patients will commonly complain of dyspnoea, fevers, cough, and sputum production.On examination, bronchial breath sounds and dullness to percussion may be appreciated in focal lung region.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A pulmonary infiltrate with or without an effusion is typically seen on chest radiograph.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Oesophagitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dysphagia and odynophagia are the predominant complaints of oesophagitis.Infectious oesophagitis typically occurs in immunocompromised patients. [55]Medications should be reviewed for common offenders of pill-induced oesophagitis. [56]History of radiation therapy may raise suspicion for radiation oesophagitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The results of barium swallow and endoscopy are dependent on the cause of oesophagitis.Candida albicans will appear as a shaggy mucosa on barium swallow and numerous small white-yellow plaques on endoscopy.HSV appears as small ulcers on barium swallow and EGD, whereas large, deep, and linear ulcers suggest CMV. [55]In suspected pill oesophagitis, endoscopy may be indicated to exclude infectious causes. [56]Barium swallow and endoscopy can demonstrate the severity of mucosal damage with radiation oesophagitis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Oesophageal spasm</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may complain of intermittent chest pain and dysphagia in the setting of oesophageal spasm. Glyceryl trinitrate can improve oesophageal spasm by inducing smooth muscle relaxation. [57]  This can make oesophageal spasm difficult to differentiate from angina.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Barium swallow may show prominent non-propulsive contractions leading to a corkscrew appearance.Oesophageal manometry may demonstrate repetitive and aperistaltic contractions. [57]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>GORD</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Oesophageal reflux typically presents as an epigastric or retrosternal burning pain, with radiation toward the throat. Patients may report resolution of the pain with a trial of antacids. [58]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Typically managed empirically with acid-suppressive therapy. Oesophageal pH monitoring can be performed to demonstrate episodes in which the oesophageal pH drops to below 4. [58]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Biliary colic</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The pain of biliary colic is localised to the RUQ, occurring 15 to 30 minutes after a meal and persisting for 3 to 4 hours. It is often associated with nausea, vomiting, and bloating. [59]  [60]  [61]",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Cholecystitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar to the pain of biliary colic, the pain of cholecystitis is localised to the RUQ and is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Unlike biliary colic, patients with cholecystitis also have fever, abdominal tenderness, and leukocytosis. [60]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound will demonstrate gallstones and/or thickening of the gallbladder wall. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan will not fill the gallbladder due to obstruction of the cystic duct. [60]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Choledocholithiasis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar to the pain of biliary colic, the pain of choledocholithiasis is localised to the RUQ and is often associated with nausea and vomiting. [61]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound generally shows dilated bile ducts and occasionally identifies a biliary stone. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones and can be helpful in relieving the biliary obstruction. [61]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Peptic ulcer disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Recurrent episodes of pain in the epigastrium with radiation to the back are common in peptic ulcer disease. The pain may temporarily improve with ingestion of food. [62]",

"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Pancreatitis, acute</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The pain of pancreatitis is located in the epigastrium and commonly radiates to the midback. It is constant, lasting for hours to days, and not relieved by vomiting or bowel movements. A history of alcohol use or gallstones may provide a specific cause. Abdominal examination varies with the severity of the attack. [63]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The diagnosis is most supported by an elevation in serum amylase and lipase 3 times the upper limit of normal. Ultrasound is useful to evaluate for cholelithiasis, while CT is useful to evaluate the extent of pancreatic inflammation or findings suggestive of pancreatic necrosis. [63]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section15'>Fibromyalgia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tender points of fibromyalgia can be located to near the sternum along the second intercostal space. Additionally, patients may complain of fatigue and chest heaviness. Patients with fibromyalgia will typically have multiple additional tender points localised to the neck, buttocks, shoulders, arms, and the upper back. [64]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is on clinical grounds by identifying point tenderness areas (typically, patients will have at least 11 of the 18 classic tender points) with no accompanying tissue swelling or inflammation, and by excluding other medical conditions as a cause. [64]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section17'>Sternoclavicular arthritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section17'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The pain of sternoclavicular arthritis is usually maximal immediately over the sternoclavicular joint. A history of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis should raise suspicion for this diagnosis. [65]",
