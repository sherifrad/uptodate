"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pelvic ultrasound is diagnostic if there are 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter, and/or increased ovarian volume (&gt;10 mL) in either or both ovaries; endometrial lining &gt;5 to 7 mm indicates endometrial thickening. There may be raised serum 17-hydroxy-progesterone, total and free testosterone, DHEAS, and prolactin.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Transvaginal ultrasound is diagnostic for ovarian endometrioma, but may not detect early disease.Rectal endoscopic ultrasound may be of value in patients with suspected deep pelvic endometriosis or involvement of the colon/rectum.Histopathology will confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis or endometrioma, with endometrial-like glandular lining cells and changes of chronic haemorrhage (fibrosis and haemosiderin-containing macrophages) in cyst wall stroma.</p>",
