"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with FHH appear healthy. There may be a positive family history of other members with high serum calcium without objective symptoms of nephrolithiasis or bone disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Renal calcium to creatinine clearance ratio is lower compared with patients with PHPT. SI units should be used instead of or in addition to those currently adopted.Diagnosis can be confirmed with genetic testing.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Positive history of solid tumour malignancy. Other manifestations of systemic signs of illness such as weight loss, fatigue, pain, and feelings of ill health.Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy occurs in patients with solid tumours of the lung, breast, kidney, ovary, and head and neck; there is typically no bone metastasis. This process is mediated primarily by PTH-related-protein/peptide (PTHrP). PTHrP also plays a role in the hypercalcaemia associated with bone metastases and multiple myeloma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Intact serum PTH is appropriately low, but PTHrP would be elevated if the source is from an ectopic malignancy.Mild hypokalaemic hypochloraemic alkalosis may be present.CXR, mammogram, and urinary analysis should be used to evaluate for malignancies.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Multiple myeloma may show weight loss.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone x-ray shows lytic bone lesions, characteristic of multiple myeloma.Gamma globulin assessment defines the disorder as well.Serum creatinine and urea levels with serum protein electrophoresis rules out multiple myeloma.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sarcoidosis occurs with a dry cough.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR shows thoracic lymphadenopathy and parenchymal lung disease.Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels may be elevated.Patients may also show eosinophilia or elevated ESR.Calcium is high, but intact serum PTH is low.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Parathyroid carcinoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Twenty percent to 50% of patients with parathyroid carcinoma have a palpable mass in the neck. Patients may also have hoarseness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> May have significantly elevated calcium (&gt;3.25 mmol/L [&gt;13.0 mg/dL] is suggestive), which should prompt suspicion. Calcium is usually higher than in patients with sporadic, benign disease.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients have a history of HTN and are on thiazide diuretic therapy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum calcium levels should decrease when thiazide medicine is discontinued and intact serum PTH levels are low.Decreases in calcium excretion lead to hypercalcaemia, but without concomitant suppression of PTH. [37]</p>",
