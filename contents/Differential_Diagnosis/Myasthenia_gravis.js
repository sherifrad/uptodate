"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Prominent proximal leg and arm weakness accompanied by diminished muscle stretch reflexes that improve with brief exercise.Autonomic symptoms such as dry mouth, constipation and impotence are present in some patients.Eye muscles are occasionally involved at presentation.Respiratory failure is uncommon.Associated with small-cell lung cancer in up to 70% of patients.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Negative anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AchR) antibody test.Antivoltage-gated calcium channel antibodies present in more than 90% of patients.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms similar to myasthenia gravis (MG) but there may be hypotension, bradycardia, diarrhoea followed by constipation, and urinary retention.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at high rates (&ge;20 Hz) may reveal a small increment in the motor response</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms similar to MG can occur after weeks or months of treatment. They may remit on withdrawal of the drug; recovery may be slow or incomplete.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anti-AchR antibody test. The properties of the AchR in these patients differ from those in patients with idiopathic myasthenia gravis in terms of specificity and affinity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Gradually progressive muscle weakness which is not fatigable.These include auto-immune inflammatory myopathies or heritable myopathies as in mitochondrial diseases, such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia, or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD).Positive family history.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Muscle biopsy may reveal the diagnosis. Ragged red fibres, accumulation of abnormal looking mitochondria in sub-sarcolemmal space and COX-negative muscle fibres suggest mitochondrial diseases. [20]Mutation analysis of a short GCG repeat expansion in PABPN1 gene is diagnostic of OPMD. [21]</p>",
