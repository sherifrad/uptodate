"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> CT shows global atrophy in AD, and focal atrophy in FTD. However, structural MRI typically shows regional losses in the temporoparietal regions in AD and the temporofrontal regions in FTD.The physical examination does not reliably distinguish the conditions, because a normal examination is usually noted. One key feature that may differentiate FTD from AD is relative preservation of memory.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT/MRI shows global atrophy in AD, and focal atrophy in FTD.Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or PET in early AD generally shows abnormality in the posterior cingulate and parietal lobes. [28]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> DLB is characterised by predominance of amnesia, fluctuation in cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism in the early stages of the illness.Personality and comportment are relatively preserved.Visual hallucinations are very rare in FTD. [29]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT/MRI shows global atrophy in DLB, and focal atrophy in FTD.SPECT or PET in early DLB generally shows abnormality in the parietal and the occipital lobes. [28]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Episodes of mania and depression typically begin in the third decade of life and show complete remission between episodes. When late-onset mania occurs after age 60 years it is attributable to brain diseases (cerebrovascular, trauma, neoplasm, drug withdrawal and/or intoxication) in &gt;80% of cases.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain imaging is generally normal in bipolar disorder.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Major depression is characterised by the marked predominance of sad mood, anhedonism, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, retardation, insomnia, and self-deprecating and pessimistic mental states. Most likely to be confused with the apathetic type of FTD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain imaging is usually normal in major depression.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In OCD onset is typically in the second and third decades of life. Remission may not be complete between episodes but OCD can be distinguished by long history and association of compulsions with preserved insight and marked anxiety. Patients with early onset dementias often try to cope with their cognitive impairment by imposing order on the threat of chaos.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain imaging is generally normal in OCD, and shows regional atrophy, hypo-perfusion, or hypo-metabolism in FTD.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> States of intoxication from stimulants, alcohol, and other agents may mimic FTD by producing euphoria, disinhibition, impulsiveness, and poor judgement, but these states are usually transient.Track marks and puncture sites may be visible on arms, legs, and neck, along the course of superficial veins.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum and urine toxicology will usually identify the substance abused.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Vascular dementia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vascular dementia may mimic FTD by presenting with prominence of apathy, executive dysfunction or behavioural disorder (impulsiveness and irritability), and relative preservation of memory.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain CT or MRI will show evidence of cerebrovascular accident; lacunes in the basal ganglia and thalamus; or marked gliosis of the frontal, sub-cortical, and deep white matter.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Primary brain tumour</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The cognitive manifestations of brain tumour depend on their location.Tumours in the frontal lobes may present with decreased attention and alertness, executive dysfunction, and impaired social judgement.Tumours in the temporal lobes may present with non-fluent aphasia and memory disorder.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain imaging will show tumour, and may also show a penumbra of oedema and compression of adjacent brain structures.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Features of hyperthyroidism, such as irritability, restlessness, increased eating (with decreased satiation), and distractibility, may result in a presentation that mimics FTD",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In hyperthyroidism, analysis of blood levels typically shows elevated levels of TSH and very low levels of free T4.</p>",
