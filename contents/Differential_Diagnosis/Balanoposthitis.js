"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by erythematous scaly patches and lichenified plaques. Pruritus is a prominent finding. Additional areas of involvement include the hands, ankles/feet, and flexural areas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.Biopsy usually not necessary but may be warranted in atypical cases.A high serum IgE level strengthens clinical suspicion of the presence of the atopic tendency.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions with slight erythema, slight to moderate scaling, and often peri-follicular or frank follicular involvement.Other commonly affected areas include scalp, ears, glabella and brows, nasolabial folds, axillae, chest, back, and groin. Slight dandruff, mild scaling of the eyebrows, or scaling lesions in the axillae or on the chest may be present.Patients typically complain of the cosmetic insult rather than of itch, which may be mild.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical (and includes noting response to treatment).Biopsy usually not necessary but may be warranted in atypical cases.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by erythematous, scaly patch or plaque corresponding to site of application of irritant.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical based on history, examination, and trial of treatment (i.e., avoiding presumed irritant).</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Allergic contact dermatitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms are pain, burning, or itching.Signs include erythema, swelling, vesiculation and exudation, or erythematous scaling and lichenification, depending on severity. These appear about 1 week after first contact with allergen, if previously unsensitised, or within hours to 1 to 2 days if sensitised.This is a relatively uncommon cause of balanoposthitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Management relies on the identification of the potential allergen and likely source, and then avoidance. There may be clues to the inciting factors at presentation, but subsequent patch testing to identify allergen(s) is required. [35]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Psoriasis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Genital psoriasis presents with variably itchy, silvery-scaled erythematous patches or plaques in circumcised men. Scale is absent from lesions on the glans penis or in the preputial sac of uncircumcised men, because of the mucosal site.Identifying other areas of involvement can help with the diagnosis of psoriasis. Commonly involved areas include the scalp, ears, umbilicus, sacrum, natal cleft, and nails.Psoriatic balanoposthitis can be part of the spectrum of inverse-pattern psoriasis (with inter-triginous and flexural site disease involvement) and may be associated with inter-triginous disease of the axillae, natal cleft, gluteal folds, and groin.Bowen disease and extra-mammary Paget's disease may be misdiagnosed as psoriasis when there are single or several foci on the penile shaft and/or in the groin.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis of psoriasis is usually clinical; sometimes a biopsy is necessary, to exclude Zoon balanitis, lichen planus, erythroplasia of Queyrat, or Kaposi's sarcoma in uncircumcised patients with solitary mucosal lesions.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Reiter's disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Skin lesions in Reiter's disease may be similar to those of psoriasis. Patients may present with features of both psoriasis and Reiter's syndrome.Classically, Reiter's patients have thickened yellow palms and soles with a cobblestone appearance, with or without pustular lesions (keratoderma blenorrhagica); and characteristic involvement of the penis (circinate balanitis), which, when severe, can result in balanoposthitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.Test for HLA-B27 is positive in approximately 75% of patients.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Lichen sclerosus</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Men with genital lichen sclerosus may be asymptomatic. Atrophic white patches (leukoderma) or plaques are most commonly seen. The lesions can also present as hyper-trophic or lilac-coloured, slightly scaly lichenoid patches or plaques with telangiectasia and sparse purpura.Patients may report symptoms signifying sexual dysfunction or dyspareunia (itching, burning, pain, bleeding, tearing, splitting, haemorrhagic blisters), discomfort with urination, and narrowing of the urinary stream and/or concerns about the changing anatomy of their genitalia. [15]  [16]  [17]  [18]  [19]  [36]Other presentations include non-retractile foreskin, paraphimosis, and urinary retention (even renal failure). The signs may be subtle with meatal narrowing and slight tightening of the prepuce (with retraction still possible) due to sclerotic plaques and bands.Severe changes due to the lichen sclerosus and associated non-specific or Zoonoid balanoposthitis include constrictive posthitis, adhesions, loss of anatomical definition, and dissolution or effacement of the normally sharply defined architectural features (e.g., frenulum and the coronal sulcus). Overt changes of Zoon balanitis may be more florid than the underlying lichen sclerosus.Other urological complications include balanoposthitis, phimosis, paraphimosis, posthitis, balanitis xerotica, and cancer.Post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation is occasionally seen.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Most cases of lichen sclerosus can be diagnosed clinically.If there is clinical doubt, a biopsy should be done. A biopsy is mandatory if a lesion or part of a lesion is eroded or verrucous (warty).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Zoon balanitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Well-demarcated, glistening, moist, shiny, bright-red or brown patches involving the glans and mucosal prepuce. The urethra (fossa navicularis) may also be involved. The lesions may demonstrate dark red stippling (cayenne pepper spots) and purpura with haemosiderin deposition.Atypical or unusual morphology should be viewed with suspicion and biopsied.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Screening for STDs is usually mandatory in patients with penile lesions presumed to represent Zoon balanitis.A properly targeted biopsy is advised; the pathologist should be encouraged to look for concomitant disease (e.g., lichen sclerosus), especially in the foreskin specimen following circumcision.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Non-specific balanoposthitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Non-specific balanoposthitis is a diagnosis of exclusion and probably not common.Candidosis may be present as a secondary opportunistic phenomenon rather than as a primary cause of disease in most, if not all, cases.Preputial dysfunction is the probable cause in all cases, and in many cases lichen sclerosus will eventually be found as the underlying morbid state.",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Gonorrhoea</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Erythematous patches may be well demarcated and look very similar to Zoon balanitis.Meatal, preputial, and penile oedema and, less commonly, painful lymphadenopathy may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Gonorrhoea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is a gram-negative, intra-cellular diplococcic organism, diagnosed by a stained smear of urethral swab. Its presence is confirmed by culture or nucleic acid amplification tests.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Candidosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Burning and soreness are more likely than itch. The glans may be eroded. Coalescent red patches or plaques involve the folds, often with superficial erosions.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical and supported by direct demonstration of the budding forms of the yeast and pseudohyphae in a KOH preparation with India ink. Microbiological culture is confirmatory.If candidosis is diagnosed, a clinical search for an underlying dermatological or medical cause should follow, as signs due to Candida may be more obvious than those of the underlying cause.</p>",
