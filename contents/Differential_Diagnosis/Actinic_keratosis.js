"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions similar to AKs, with similar distribution, but usually solitary. Can become larger, indurated, inflamed, redder, ulcerated, and bleeding.Can occur on covered areas including mucous membranes and genital areas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows an intra-epithelial SCC in situ.Atypical (anaplastic) keratinocytes are present throughout the entire epidermis, including follicular infundibulum.There is a thick parakeratotic horny layer and large dyskeratotic cells. Basement membrane is intact. [3]  [4]  [12]  [11]  [49]  [48]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions begin similarly to AKs or Bowen's disease.Generally a larger red ulcer with a thick border and a granular base.Has the potential to metastasise.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows atypical (anaplastic) keratinocytes throughout entire epidermis, invading dermis.Differentiated tumours have fewer atypical cells and more keratinisation (e.g., horn pearls) than undifferentiated.Anti-cytokeratin 13 antibodies distinguish them from other tumours.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Very early and late lesions are most likely to resemble AKs. [3]  [49]  Clinically similar to well-differentiated SCC.Dome-shaped lesion, colour of normal skin or red, with a central keratinous crater.Grows rapidly but tends to regress spontaneously.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Early lesion skin biopsy shows ill-defined epidermal invaginations into dermis, containing keratinocytes with little nuclear atypia and mitotic figures, and some dyskeratotic cells.Developed lesion biopsy shows a centred crater filled with keratin, surrounded by lip-shaped epidermal extensions.
