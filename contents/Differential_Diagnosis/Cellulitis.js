"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Initial findings are non-specific and can be similar to those of cellulitis.Marked pain, often out of proportion to the exam, and necrotic bullous change are clinical clues.Crepitus may be present if a mixed anaerobic aetiology is responsible.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Surgical exploration is definitive for diagnosis and a requirement for treatment. This is limb- and potentially life-threatening, and surgical consultation should not be delayed if necrotising fasciitis is suspected. MRI is helpful if the diagnosis is in doubt. [35]  [36]MRI: contrast enhancement, thickening of deep fasciae with fluid collection.</p>",
