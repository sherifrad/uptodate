"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Self-limiting watery diarrhoea, vomiting, or both, with or without fever, malaise, and anorexia, are common presenting symptoms. Diarrhoea and vomiting are less common in ascariasis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> It is not usually necessary to perform stool examinations on patients with viral gastroenteritis. However, a stool sample should be obtained if there is an outbreak, to identify the pathogen as quickly as possible. Stool culture is the most definitive diagnostic test in identification of viral pathogens, but this is not practical in most cases. Latex agglutination tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microscopy, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or serology allows rapid detection, but these are usually not necessary.</p>",
