"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Giant urticaria can be annular with central clearance, but central blistering and target lesions will be absent. While urticaria may recur, resolution of lesions in 24 hours is the norm, but virtually never occurs in EM. Daily new lesions occur in urticaria, but not in EM after the first 72 hours. [2]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dermatographism (urtication after pressure) is common in urticaria.Biopsies will distinguish the type of inflammatory infiltrate.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Id reactions that are annular plaques surrounding a molluscum (pearly papules with central dells) can mimic target lesions. Careful inspection of the central zone to identify the pearly papules with a central dell will aid in diagnosis. Lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum will be both itchy and fixed for extended times, as opposed to lesions caused by EM. [18]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Unroofing the central zone of a targetoid lesion will demonstrate cheesy white material in molluscum, or fluid for blisters of EM.</p>",
