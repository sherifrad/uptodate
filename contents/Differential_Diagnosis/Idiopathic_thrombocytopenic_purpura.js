"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A spuriously low count in disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) occurs in 0.1% of adults. It is important to recognise this condition when it occurs because it is benign, and so potentially dangerous diagnostic tests and treatments can be avoided.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ex-vivo agglutination, or clumping, can lead to spuriously low platelet counts on automated counters because the machine is unable to detect and count the individual platelets that make up a clump. This may account for up to 15% to 30% of all cases of isolated thrombocytopenia. [13]Peripheral smear shows platelet clumps.Platelet satellitism, where platelets form a ring around neutrophils, may also be seen.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Congenital impaired platelet production</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is a broad category, which includes several congenital syndromes. The bleeding may be worse than expected for the platelet count reported, as platelet function may also be impaired in addition to impaired platelet production.Congenital disorders may have associated facial dysmorphism, heart defects, mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities, high-tone sensorineural deafness, nephritis and cataracts.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Macrothrombocytes and Dohle body-like inclusions in leukocytes on peripheral smear.A subpopulation of platelets with giant alpha granules is seen in Paris-Trousseau syndrome.Platelet function analyser (PFA-100) testing may indicate prolonged time to clotting, which suggests impaired function.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Thrombocytopenia related to liver disease or alcohol ingestion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Large amounts of alcohol consumption can directly suppress bone marrow production of platelets. [14]  Thrombopoietin is produced in the liver and so severely impaired liver synthetic function can lead to a decrease in platelet production stimulation.Physical examination may demonstrate signs of liver failure including splenomegaly, ascites, varices, spider angiomata, palmar erythema and gynaecomastia.Massive splenomegaly from liver disease can lead to exaggerated splenic pooling and thrombocytopenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT and AST.Prolonged prothrombin time.Decreased serum albumin.Megaloblastic peripheral smear with macrocytic RBC, hypersegmented neutrophils and Howell-Jolly bodies (chromosomal remnants in RBC) suggests vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May demonstrate neurological changes or fever as well as signs of anaemia and thrombocytopenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC shows anaemia and thrombocytopenia with fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) on blood smear (microangiopathic film).Elevated creatinine.Protein and blood present on urinalysis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> DIC is a disorder of coagulation that occurs in the setting of other medical conditions such as sepsis, trauma, malignancy, pregnancy, and amniotic fluid embolism.Patients are usually very unwell with significant bleeding due to coagulation defects.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC shows a micro-angiopathic picture with anaemia, thrombocytopenia and fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) on blood smear.Prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.Elevated D-dimer.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Sepsis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with sepsis can develop thrombocytopenia. These patients have hypotension, fever and other signs of sepsis. Treatment of the underlying infection should correct the thrombocytopenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated white cell count with left shift.Peripheral smear may show vacuoles in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, which is highly specific for bacteraemia.Blood cultures may be positive.Thrombocytopenia and anaemia are often related to a concurrent DIC phenomenon.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically, occurs in pregnant women who are already being followed up for gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia.Patients are hypertensive and may complain of headache, nausea and abdominal discomfort.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Low haemoglobin, low haptoglobin and elevated unconjugated bilirubin consistent with haemolytic anaemia.Elevated LFTs.Low platelets.May have abnormal coagulation studies if DIC present.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Gestational thrombocytopenia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In general, gestational thrombocytopenia is more common and milder with platelet counts &gt;70 x 10^9/L (&gt;70 x 10^3/microlitre). It occurs in late gestation and recovers completely after delivery.Gestational thrombocytopenia has no risk to the baby, whereas ITP in pregnancy can cause thrombocytopenia in the newborn.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There is no absolute test to differentiate between gestational thrombocytopenia and ITP in pregnancy.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> MDS is a rare cause of isolated thrombocytopenia. Incidence increases with age so bone marrow biopsy (which can differentiate ITP from MDS) is recommended in the work-up of patients over 60 years of age with isolated thrombocytopenia.Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are uncommon but may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC usually shows a decrease in other cell lines but isolated thrombocytopenia can occur in up to 5% of cases. [15]PFA-100 test shows abnormal platelet function.Bone marrow biopsy is diagnostic.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Type IIB von Willebrand's disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Autosomal-dominant disorder so may have known family history.A gain-of-function mutation in von Willebrand factor results in binding to platelets and clearance of platelets from the circulation.These patients have bleeding out of proportion to their platelet count.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Decreased von Willebrand factor activity.Increased ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation.Decreased large von Willebrand factor multimers on electrophoresis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Splenomegaly/hypersplenism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Splenomegaly can lead to a reversible pooling of up to 90% of the total body platelet count whereas hypersplenism results in early destruction of platelets in the spleen.Patients may have palpable splenomegaly and signs of the underlying cause of splenomegaly, such as lymphadenopathy in lymphoma or jaundice and spider nevi in portal hypertension due to liver disease. Consider also a diagnosis of Gaucher's disease and other thesaurismoses.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound and CT scan will show splenomegaly.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Drug-induced thrombocytopenia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A thorough medicine and herbal supplement history is important for identifying potential offending drugs.Many drugs have been implicated including quinidine, quinine, rifampin and bactrim. Herbal remedies can also be implicated including tonic water (contains quinine) and tahini (a component of hummus).Resolution of thrombocytopenia when drug ceased.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section14'>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A medicine history will reveal the use of heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin.HIT affects up to 5% of patients exposed to heparin. Thrombocytopenia usually occurs 5 to 14 days after starting heparin therapy (but can occur sooner if there has been a prior heparin exposure).Up to 50% of patients with HIT can develop thrombosis if not treated properly with alternative anticoagulation (i.e., the use of a direct thrombin inhibitor) so cessation of heparin alone is inadequate. [16]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A heparin aggregation study demonstrates the presence of platelet aggregation when exposed to heparin. This is caused by antibodies to platelet factor 4.</p>",
