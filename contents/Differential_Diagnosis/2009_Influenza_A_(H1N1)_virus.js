"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections are not usually associated with fever, especially in adults.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In most cases, testing for viral infections (e.g., culture) is not performed except in cases where the patient is immunocompromised.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Seasonal influenza</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most commonly seen during the winter months.Generally, diarrhoea and vomiting are less commonly seen with seasonal influenza.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinically, distinguishing between seasonal and swine influenza is not necessary, except from an infection control or public health standpoint. Reverse transcriptase-PCR distinguishes between the 2 infections based upon positive reactivity with either the human seasonal influenza panel or the swine influenza panel.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a known complication of influenza infection, although the incidence is unknown. Bacterial pneumonias also occur more frequently in the winter, when seasonal influenza is circulating. Cough is usually productive. Shortness of breath is more prominent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR demonstrates findings ranging from focal infiltrates to diffuse infiltrates to lobar consolidation, depending on severity and aetiology of the bacterial infection. Influenza infections can cause interstitial infiltrates, but lobar consolidation is uncommon, unless a secondary bacterial pneumonia is present.FBC may reveal elevated WBC count.Sputum or blood culture may reveal positive Gram stain.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>SARS</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually a history of travel within 10 days of onset to a location with documented or suspected recent SARS transmission, or a history of close and prolonged contact with a SARS patient.Early symptoms are typically non-specific (e.g., myalgia, malaise, headache) followed by fever. Cough, which is usually non-productive, develops 2 to 7 days after symptom onset. Dyspnoea is a late symptom, as is a watery diarrhoea, which occurs in the second week in up to 25% of patients.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tests for influenza virus are negative. Reverse transcriptase-PCR is positive for the SARS virus.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Meningitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have similar presentation to influenza infection in children. Headache, neck stiffness, and rash are likely to be more prominent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tests for influenza virus are negative. CSF analysis may show increased WBC count, elevated protein, a positive Gram stain (in bacterial meningitis). PCR may be positive for viruses other than influenza in viral meningitis.</p>",
