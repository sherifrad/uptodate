"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Underlying diabetes mellitus, renal failure, alcoholism, or malnutrition.Symptoms of pain, burning, and hyperalgesia are symmetrical and tend to begin in the distal lower extremities and affect the upper extremities later.There is usually no history of trauma, and most peripheral neuropathies progress gradually.If large fibres are involved there is a loss of reflexes, weakness, and vibratory and proprioceptive deficits.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nerve conduction studies and EMG reveal abnormal action potentials detected symmetrically.Elevated urea and creatinine with renal failure.Elevated fasting blood glucose &gt;125 mg/dL with diabetes mellitus.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Focal or entrapment neuropathies</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms and signs are confined to the distribution of the affected nerve (e.g., carpal tunnel, cubital tunnel, or thoracic outlet syndrome).No history of trauma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually a clinical diagnosis.Nerve conduction abnormalities confined to the affected nerve and its innervated musculature.MRI reveals a high-intensity signal at point of entrapment. Only useful for large nerves (e.g., ulnar).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Deep vein thrombosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Swelling, pain, and discoloration of the affected extremity. Burning, electrical, or shooting pains are uncommon.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Compression ultrasonography shows non-compressibility of vascular lumen on gentle pressure.Impedance plethysmography may reveal a reduction in venous emptying and consequent slower rise in impedance. Result is operator-dependent.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Thrombophlebitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Focal pain, swelling, tenderness, erythema, and a palpable cord in the affected vein.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually a clinical diagnosis.Compression ultrasonography may be used to detect spread of inflammation to deep veins.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Lymphoedema</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often secondary to surgery, radiation, or infection. Onset is insidious; oedema is non-pitting; pain is usually aching in nature.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lymphoscintigraphy outlines the anatomy of the lymphatic system and identifies areas of obstruction to flow.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Gout</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Affects joints, most commonly the big toe.Sudden onset; may have history of symptoms or gouty tophi visible in long-standing hyperuricaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually a clinical diagnosis.Synovial fluid aspirate shows monosodium urate crystals.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Pseudogout</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can present as acute mono-articular arthritis or a poly-articular symmetrical arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Typically affects shoulders and wrists.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Synovial fluid aspirate shows calcium pyrophosphate crystals.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Scleroderma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Accompanied by other features of scleroderma: skin tightness, calcinosis, itching, Raynaud's syndrome, or elevated blood pressure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presence of antinuclear antibodies on serological testing.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Tenosynovitis due to spondyloarthropathy (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain to palpation at site of tendon insertion; common sites include Achilles tendon and insertion of plantar fascia onto calcaneus.Associated features of a spondyloarthropathy (e.g., morning stiffness, fatigue, low-grade fever, low back pain, or extra-articular manifestations).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosed on clinical criteria and radiographic findings of bony erosion and periosteal new bone formation.HLA-B27 antigen positive in majority of cases but not usually tested.</p>",
