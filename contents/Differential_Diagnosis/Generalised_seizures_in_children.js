"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characteristics of non-epileptic attacks help to differentiate them from epileptic seizures. [35]  It is important to note that non-epileptic attacks often occur in children who are also experiencing true epileptic seizures.Can be provoked by emotional precipitants, do not occur while the patient is asleep and are intractable despite adequate medicine. Tend to occur in the presence of witnesses.Onset of the seizure is often gradual and injury during the fall at the start of the seizure is rare.No post-ictal phase or amnesia for the time surrounding the event. No pathological reflexes elicitable just after the seizure.Patient may have history of sexual or other abuse.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal EEG during the event.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often precipitated by anger or frustration.Typically vigorous cry is followed by a period of blocked respiration resulting in cyanosis, loss of consciousness and sometimes opisthotonic posturing (i.e., muscle spasm leading to pronounced hyper-extension with head and lower limbs bent backwards and the trunk arched forwards).",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often positive family history.History of syncope triggered by pain, fear, or exercise.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG shows prolonged corrected QT interval.No epileptic discharges on EEG during the episode but, depending on the duration of asystole, hypoxic slowing of the EEG may be seen during the attack.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tilt-table testing can confirm a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope, the most common type.12-lead ECG is the only test needed and excludes prolonged QT syndrome.</p>",
