"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Non-specific worsening of pre-existing or coincidental asthma due to workplace irritants such as dust and fumes, or common allergens that may be present in the workplace. [15]  [35]Usually a history of preceding asthma before the job, which is associated with worsening asthma symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Negative specific inhalation challenge (when the correct agent is identified and the test is available) and lack of change in serial non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness (NSBHR) testing are suggestive of work-exacerbated asthma.However, lack of change in airway responsiveness away from the suspected work agent does not exclude OA. Advanced or long-standing sensitiser-induced OA may be associated with less temporal variability in symptoms and lung function with workplace exposures.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Bronchitis (chronic cough) worse at work may be present but without other manifestations of asthma (e.g., wheezing). [3]",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Asthma is a common condition that frequently will have an onset, or recurrence, in adult life. The clinician should take a history of the home environment to identify other potential allergens such as a cat or dust. Without the identification of features of irritant-induced OA, a workplace sensitiser, or objective evidence of worsening at the workplace to suggest sensitiser-induced OA, unrelated asthma should be considered. [15]  [37]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis: lack of features to suggest irritant-induced OA or changes in symptoms, medication needs, pulmonary function, or bronchial hyper-responsiveness associated with workplace exposures that suggest sensitiser-induced OA make the presence of non-occupational asthma more likely.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Many substances that cause OA may also cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), including diisocyanate exposure.In HP, wheezing tends not to be a prominent feature, and patients with the acute form may experience fevers and chills.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Absence of (or mild) NSBHROther pulmonary function abnormalities associated with HP include a restrictive ventilatory defect and impairment in gas transfer.Chest x-ray shows patchy, nodular infiltrates in acute and subacute HP; fibrosis in chronic HP.High-resolution CT chest in chronic HP shows ground-glass shadowing/attenuation and poorly defined micronodules. There is extensive honeycombing in late stages.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dyspnoea may occur with or without wheezing, cough, or sputum. Examination may show barrel chest, hyper-resonance to percussion, and distant breath sounds.It is estimated that approximately 15% of COPD may be work-related from exposure to factors such as mineral and organic dusts. [38]  COPD should especially be considered if there is a history of tobacco use and less day-to-day variability in symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lack of significant variability in airflow obstruction and an absence of or only mild NSBRH (although COPD and asthma may co-exist).</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Upper airway disorders are common asthma masqueraders. [39]  Asthma may be present in addition to vocal cord dysfunction.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary function testing may suggest extrathoracic airflow limitation as caused by paradoxical vocal cord movement by the presence of a flattened inspiratory flow volume loop. [40]Lack of objective airflow obstruction or NSBHR is supportive of the diagnosis; however, assessment by an otolaryngologist and speech therapist experienced in the field is recommended. [39]</p>",
