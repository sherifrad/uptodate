"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Preterm labour and placental abruption may co-exist. Careful clinical assessment is essential to differentiate between preterm labour and abruption (10% of idiopathic preterm labour is due to placental abruption).Bleeding is light rather than moderate-to-heavy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound may be helpful. Positive findings may be diagnostic of abruption. Preterm labour generally is associated with a normal ultrasound and generally does not result in fetal heart rate abnormalities or DIC.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Classically presents with painless vaginal bleeding; however, painful contractions may accompany this.Bleeding when placenta praevia has been excluded by ultrasound should be considered to be due to abruption until shown otherwise.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A sonogram, including a search for ultrasound signs of abruption and sonographic assessment of the area over the cervix, may be useful in distinguishing between the 2 conditions. In placenta praevia, the placenta will be seen overlying the internal cervical os.Occasionally, trans-vaginal sonography may be used to examine the lower uterine segment in order to exclude placenta praevia.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No vaginal bleeding.Fibroids may occasionally be palpable; however, they may also be associated with abruption and preterm labour, so caution should be exercised to ensure that women with fibroids are not having an abruption.Point tenderness on palpation over the location of the fibroid, particularly when there is no bleeding, will make abruption unlikely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Fibroids can generally be identified on sonography.</p>",
