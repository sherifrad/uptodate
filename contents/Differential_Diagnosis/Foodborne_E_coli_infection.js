"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually has a more chronic history, with slower deterioration.Symptoms vary from intermittent rectal bleeding associated with the passage of mucus to frequent loose, bloody stools.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Definitive diagnosis is made by colonic mucosal biopsy showing characteristic histological changes. Vascular markings are lost, owing to engorgement of the mucosa, giving it an erythematous appearance. In addition, petechiae, exudates, touch friability, and frank haemorrhage may be present. Colonic involvement is continuous.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually has a more chronic history, with slower deterioration, and prolonged diarrhoea, often accompanied by weight loss.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows focal ulcerations adjacent to areas of normal-appearing mucosa, along with polypoid mucosal changes that give a cobblestone appearance. Pseudopolyps are also often present. May involve the entire GI tract from mouth to peri-anal area.</p>",
