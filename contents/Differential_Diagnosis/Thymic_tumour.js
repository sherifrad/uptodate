"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of persistently enlarged lymph nodes, constitutional or B symptoms (fevers, night sweats, and/or weight loss). Physical examination reveals lymphadenopathy in one or more regions; hepatosplenomegaly may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest CT scan usually shows matted lymphadenopathy. Peripheral lymph node excision biopsy will reveal type of lymphoma.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in people aged 20 to 40 years, with male predominance.Presenting symptoms depend on tumour location, growth rate, and size; they include chest pressure, hoarseness, chest wall pain, dysphagia, and dyspnoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest CT scan usually shows homogeneous invasive malignant-appearing anterior mediastinal mass.Serum alpha-fetoprotein normal; may have low-level elevation of serum beta-hCG.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patient is typically a young male with significant symptoms of systemic and local invasion, such as fatigue, weight loss, fever, dyspnoea, and chest pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum alpha-fetoprotein and beta-hCG usually elevated.Chest CT scan usually shows a large, inhomogeneous invasive mass with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis; pleural effusion often present; may show lung metastases.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Older patient usually without symptoms. Rarely, patients have upper-chest discomfort, dyspnoea, or hoarseness. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (heat intolerance, weight loss, insomnia) may be present.A visible goitre is present in 80% to 90% of patients; substernal extension is suggested if the lower pole of the thyroid gland cannot be identified. Airway compression may present with stridor and prolonged inspiration/expiration. Signs of thyrotoxicosis, including weight loss, hypertension, and tachycardia, may be evident on physical examination. Tracheal deviation can occur if the goitre is asymmetrical. Pemberton's signs (neck vein distension and facial flushing when arms are held vertically above head [Pemberton's manoeuvre]) may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest CT shows anterior mediastinal mass contiguous with the thyroid; mass often has low-density areas and calcifications.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Always asymptomatic. Can be seen with myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, burns, following viral illnesses, and as a rebound phenomenon (e.g., following chemotherapy, especially for Hodgkin's disease).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest CT usually shows residual shape of bilobed thymus without a dominant rounded mass. View imageChemical-shift MRI may be helpful in differentiating hyperplasia from tumour in problematical cases.</p>",
