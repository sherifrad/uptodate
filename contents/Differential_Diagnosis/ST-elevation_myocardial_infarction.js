"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically present with tearing chest pain, notably between the shoulder blades.They can be in considerable distress and haemodynamically unstable.Peripheral pulses may be unequal or absent distally.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR may show a widened mediastinum.ECG may be unremarkable, show sinus tachycardia, or show ST-segment changes if the dissection extends proximally and involves the coronary ostium.A CT of chest and abdomen with IV contrast showing the presence of a dissection flap and a true lumen and false lumen is diagnostic for aortic dissection.A trans-oesophageal echocardiogram may also show the dissection flap with the true and false lumens.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients classically present with acute onset of sharp stabbing chest pain that is pleuritic in nature and associated with SOB.A background of increased clotting tendency, such as known inheritable thrombophilia or connective tissue disease; known deep venous thrombosis (DVT); or previous PE increases the likelihood of the diagnosis.Other risk factors include recent prolonged immobilisation and limb trauma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients are hypoxic with an increased arterial-alveolar gradient on the arterial blood gas.ECG may show sinus tachycardia or right ventricular strain with prominent S wave in lead I, prominent Q in lead III, and flipped T in lead III (S1Q3T3), or can be unremarkable.D-dimer is useful for screening. A negative d-dimer excludes PE; if positive, further work-up is required to confirm PE.V/Q scan of the lungs will show a mis-match between ventilation and perfusion images. A high-probability scan confirms PE and a normal scan excludes PE. Indeterminate scans need further work-up if indicated by the clinical picture.Spiral CT scanning of the chest with contrast will show a filling defect in the pulmonary artery if a blood clot is present.Pulmonary angiography is the test of choice to show thrombus in the pulmonary artery; however, it is an invasive study and is uncommonly used.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients present with sudden onset of pleuritic chest discomfort and SOB.Tachycardia, hypotension, and cyanosis suggest a tension pneumothorax.Known underlying medical conditions that predispose to pneumothorax, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, or recent chest trauma, may support this diagnosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR shows a visceral pleural line.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients usually have an insidious onset of fevers, cough (that may be productive of sputum), and SOB.Chest discomfort may be pleuritic in nature.Examination will usually confirm pneumonic consolidation with decreased resonance, decreased air entry, and rales over the affected lung.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> WBC count is usually elevated with neutrophilia.CXR shows increased alveolar markings.Blood and sputum cultures may be positive for an infective organism.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients can present with chest pain of varying quality that is typically better on sitting up and leaning forwards and worse with lying down.There may be a history of recent viral syndrome and a pericardial friction rub on clinical examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG may have diffuse ST-segment elevation that is concave up ('saddle-shaped') with PR segment depression. [16]Cardiac biomarkers can be elevated if inflammation extends into the myocardium.Inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR may be elevated.CXR demonstrating a globular cardiac shadow is suggestive.Echocardiogram may show a pericardial effusion or may be unremarkable.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients often have a recent history of influenza-like illness or underlying autoimmune condition such as SLE.They are likely to be young and often do not have risk factors for CAD.Myocarditis is more likely to present with symptoms of cardiac failure than with chest pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG changes and cardiac biomarkers can mimic MI.Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) and autoimmune assays may be elevated.Test of choice is endomyocardial biopsy.</p>",
