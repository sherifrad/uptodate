"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> GBS typically progresses for &lt;4 weeks. In cases that progress for 4 to 8 weeks, distinction can be difficult, because these cases tend to behave more like CIDP than GBS. [6]  [7]Some subacute presentations of CIDP can be monophasic as in GBS. [8]  [9]More frequent antecedent infection, respiratory failure, cranial nerve involvement, and autonomic dysfunction. [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Demyelinating features on nerve conduction studies tend to be less severe. [48]CSF abnormalities are less common and CSF protein is often not elevated. [1]  [2]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Early age of onset, slow progression of weakness, skeletal deformities (e.g., pes cavus), and extremely distal weakness. [62]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrodiagnostic features include uniform slowing of conduction velocities and the absence of conduction block. [63]Terminal latency index, the modified F ratio, and dispersion of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude may also differentiate. [64]  [65]Nerve biopsy more often shows areas of abnormally thickened or folded (tamaculous) myelin or areas of hypomyelination in HMSN. [66]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Conduction block rarely occurs. [68]Electrodiagnostic finding of prolonged distal latencies out of proportion to slowed conduction velocities is a hallmark. [69]The presence of anti-MAG antibodies by ELISA and Western blot is seen in essentially all patients. [70]  [71]Widely spaced myelin is the classic pathological finding. [68]Patients do not respond to corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange, [72]  [68]  [73]  but recent studies suggest that patients may respond to rituximab. [74]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum and urine immunofixation will detect the monoclonal protein. [11]  [32]  [33]Patients often respond less well to immunotherapy. [75]If immunoglobulin level is &gt;15 g/L (&gt;1.5 g/dL), check for a haematological malignancy. [76]</p>",
