"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain are usually of a shorter duration than in histoplasmosis pneumonia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest x-ray with lobar consolidation for typical or bilateral interstitial infiltrates for atypical pneumonia.Hilar lymphadenopathy is not seen.Sputum Gram stain and culture with many neutrophils and bacteria other than normal oral flora.Good response to appropriate antibiotic therapy.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with advanced HIV/AIDS with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia present with fevers and night sweats that may be indistinguishable from features of pulmonary histoplasmosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum staining with methenamine silver ('silver stain') demonstrating round or crescent-shaped cysts typical of P jiroveci. Elevated serum LDH &gt;3.64 microkat/L (&gt;220 units/L). Although elevated levels of LDH are a non-specific finding, rising levels despite adequate therapy are a marker for poor prognosis in patients with PCP. Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with symptoms that can be difficult to differentiate clinically from acute and chronic histoplasmosis pneumonia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum smears demonstrating the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Sputum cultures growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PPD skin test with &ge;15 mm induration.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Autoimmune disorder characterised by non-caseating granulomas of various organs and multi-system involvement including erythema nodosum, polyarthritis, uveitis, cranial neuropathy, and other features.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest x-ray shows hilar and/or paratracheal adenopathy with upper lobe predominant, bilateral infiltrates, pleural effusions (rare), and egg shell calcifications (very rare).Elevated serum ACE level &gt;40 micrograms/L.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms include cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, and/or dyspnoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum cytology showing malignant cells. Chest CT scan will show pulmonary nodules or hilar lymphadenopathy, or secondary pulmonary metastases from other cancers.Pathological confirmation of malignancy is the only widely accepted method of diagnosing lung cancer. Tissue is sampled from bronchoscopy where possible, and malignant cells identified by pathology. Transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy, typically using CT guidance, is used to biopsy suspicious peripheral pulmonary lesions that are not accessible with bronchoscopy. Alternatively, lymph node biopsy or biopsy during mediastinoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or an open surgical procedure are used.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Infection is sub-clinical in the majority of patients, although symptomatic infection may be clinically very similar to histoplasmosis pneumonia.Regions endemic for Coccidioides in the US are distinct from those for Histoplasma capsulatum and include southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. [30]Patients with coccidioidal infection may also develop a constellation of fever, rash, and transient arthritis/arthralgia.",
