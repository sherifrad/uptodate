"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May mimic or be indistinguishable from scalp SD to the extent that the term 'sebopsoriasis' is employed.Nail pitting, intergluteal pinking (erythematous plaques of the intergluteal fold), arthralgia, and the extensor distribution of psoriatic plaques are characteristic features.",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May appear as an erythematous papule with scale more firmly adherent than that of SD.Palpated more easily than visualised and has a roughened quality on palpation.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sub-acute SLE may have similar clinical features.SLE plaques are less scaly, carmine-coloured, and have a more firmly adherent scale.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy shows perivascular cellular infiltrate. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests reveal immunoglobulin deposition.Serum ANA and anti-ENA may be positive.</p>",
