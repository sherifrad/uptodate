"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Classic ECG has shortened PR interval and delta wave on the QRS complex, which may degenerate into AF. View imageAn electrophysiological study with view to curative ablation procedure is suggested for patients with ECG changes suggestive of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who present with AF and rapid ventricular rate.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG shows abnormal P waves. In multifocal atrial tachycardia, there are at least 3 different morphologies of P waves. View image</p>",
