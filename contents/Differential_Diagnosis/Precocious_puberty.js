"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Isolated, often fluctuating, unilateral or bilateral breast development.Unaccompanied by other signs of puberty.Growth velocity is normal and bone age is not advanced.Presents typically between 6 months and 4 years of age in girls.Benign and self-limiting.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis.Typically associated with only a minimal degree or no increase of FSH secretion; LH is normal.US pelvis may demonstrate small follicular development.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Early or exaggerated adrenarche.Pubic hair development. No breast development and only a minimal increase in growth velocity.Typically presents between 7 and 9 years, particularly in girls, and those in the black population.Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and virilising adrenal tumours need to be excluded.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis.Mild increase in serum androgens: testosterone and dehydroepiandrostenedione sulphate (DHEAS).GnRH test is normal with prepubertal concentrations of FSH and LH.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The classic form, 21-hydroxylase, presents as ambiguous genitalia in girls and precocious puberty in boys. In addition, the salt wasting form may present with an adrenal crisis.An increased height velocity, advanced bone age, and genital maturation in the absence of testicular enlargement in boys or breast development in girls (i.e., disconsonant puberty) suggests CAH.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) is elevated in 21-hydroxylase classic CAH.Other adrenal hormone precursors are elevated in other forms of CAH.A standard ACTH stimulation test is often necessary to stimulate these adrenal hormone precursors.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A short history of virilisation, accelerated growth rate, and advanced bone age is present. Cushing's syndrome may be present if there is hypersecretion of cortisol.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urinary steroid profile analysis reveals an abnormal pattern of adrenal hormone secretion.Imaging of the adrenal glands identifies the tumour.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Cushing's syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Due to adrenal disease.Presents with virilisation, without testicular enlargement in boys or breast development in girls, in addition to typical Cushingoid features such as central obesity with thin extremities, nuchal fat pad, moon facies, purple striae, bruisability.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol is elevated.8 a.m. serum cortisol is elevated with loss of diurnal rhythm.ACTH is undetectable.Low and high dexamethasone suppression tests show failure of cortisol suppression.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Females present with obesity, hirsutism, acne, oily skin, and weight gain.Virilisation (pubic and axillary hair) may be present without breast development.On examination the patient is usually obese and may have acanthosis nigricans.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> US pelvis may show polycystic ovaries with a peripheral pattern of follicular distribution, and variable endometrial thickness.Serum testosterone, androstenedione, DHEAS, and basal LH are elevated.Fasting insulin is elevated, with concomitant lowering of sex hormone binding globulin, indicating insulin resistance.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Primary hypothyroidism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Long-standing hypothyroidism can result in high TSH with elevated FSH, leading to isolated breast development or testicular enlargement without other secondary sexual characteristics.There is no pubertal progression in the majority of cases; bone age is delayed and growth velocity is poor.TSH directly activates the FSH receptor, as the two hormones have structural similarity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Low FT4; elevated TSH.</p>",
