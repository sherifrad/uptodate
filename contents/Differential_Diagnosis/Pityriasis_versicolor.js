"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Primarily affects acral areas of the body such as the hands and feet, as well as the face. Depigmented, rather than hypopigmented, lesions with no associated scale.Highlighting of depigmented areas with Wood lamp viewing but no fluorescence in lesions of vitiligo. In addition, vitiligo is usually distributed in a symmetric pattern, whereas the hypopigmented lesions of PV may or may not be symmetric.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy: negative with KOH preparation.Skin biopsy demonstrating absent melanocytes in affected skin with no hyphae or spores within the stratum corneum.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Inflammatory (red) annular plaques with leading-edge scale, central hypopigmentation, and folliculocentric pustules on any body surface.Inflammatory lesions are often associated with pruritus.No fluorescence with Wood lamp viewing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Septate hyphae with no yeast on KOH preparation.Dermatophyte fungus (usually Trichophyton rubrum) on Sabouraud mycological media.Skin biopsy demonstrates septate hyphae, with no yeast, in the stratum corneum, and frequently reveals an inflammatory infiltrate.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often associated with PV and occurs in similar distribution on the trunk. However, seborrhoeic dermatitis is also often present on the scalp, face, ear canals, groin, and gluteal crease.Erythema and pruritus common.No associated pigmentary abnormalities.No fluorescence on Wood lamp viewing. Seborrhoeic dermatitis can be seen in all age groups.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy: yeast may be present on KOH preparation. However, associated hyphal forms are absent.Skin biopsy does not demonstrate the characteristic short hyphae and budding yeast of PV, and instead often reveals pronounced epidermal spongiosis, acanthosis, and an inflammatory infiltrate.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Pityriasis rosea</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar scale to PV but no associated hypopigmentation. Erythematous discrete macules, often pruritic, on the entire trunk with a Christmas tree pattern (individual lesions run parallel to the lines of skin cleavage). Begins with a solitary 'herald patch' before abrupt onset of eruption and resolves over 3 to 8 weeks with no chronicity or recurrence.No fluorescence with Wood lamp viewing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy: negative with KOH preparation.Skin biopsy does not demonstrate fungal forms and instead reveals epidermal acanthosis, spongiosis, mounding parakeratosis, and lymphocytic inflammation.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Frequently seen on the faces and arms of children with underlying atopic dermatitis.No fluorescence with Wood lamp viewing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy: negative with KOH preparation.Skin biopsy does not demonstrate fungal forms and instead reveals mild epidermal spongiosis, and hyper- and parakeratosis with absent to mild lymphocytic inflammation.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sharply demarcated brown scaly patches localised to intertriginous areas of the axillae, genitocrural crease, and web spaces of the toes.Wood lamp examination, the optimal diagnostic tool, demonstrates coral red fluorescence instead of the yellow seen in PV.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy: negative with KOH preparation.Skin biopsy does not demonstrate fungal forms and instead reveals gram-positive coccobacilli (often appear filamentous on haematoxylin-eosin-, periodic acid-Schiff-, or Giemsa-stained sections) in the stratum corneum.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Faintly erythematous to hyperpigmented, slightly scaly macules and patches in the intermammary and upper trunk similar to PV. However, no hypopigmentation. Confluent lesions on the central chest with reticulated peripheral borders.No fluorescence with Wood lamp viewing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy with KOH preparation often reveals budding yeast with no hyphae (no spaghetti-and-meatballs appearance).Skin biopsy demonstrates mild hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis limited to the valleys between elongated papillae. Yeast often present but no hyphae.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Variety of presentations. Often presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous papules with overlying scale on the trunk, face, groin, and extremities with characteristic involvement of palms and soles. Mucus membrane lesions and generalised lymphadenopathy often present.Negative Wood lamp examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy: negative with KOH preparation.Positive non-treponemal and treponemal serological testing.Skin biopsy demonstrates psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with a band-like and perivascular plasma cell-rich infiltrate.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Eruption begins with erythematous plaque with satellite papules that eventually become hyperpigmented and heal with depigmented macules primarily on the face, waistline, wrist flexures, and trochanteric region.
