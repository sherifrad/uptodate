"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Three paired blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) to detect causative organism. Previous antibiotic exposure decreases the yield.Keep blood cultures long enough to exclude HACEK organisms (Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae), although these are not specifically associated with vascular complications.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Absence of chronic B-type symptoms, such as fevers, weight loss, myalgias, and arthralgias.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Difficult to assess after anticoagulation therapy has started.Heterozygous factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations (which can be diagnosed through genetic testing) are common and generally not severe enough to mimic vasculitis.It is important to rule out the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome by looking for anticardiolipin antibodies or a prolonged dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT).</p>",
