"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hx of diabetes. Foot wounds occur in the presence of peripheral neuropathy secondary to repetitive stress.Ulcers form on the plantar aspect of the foot or on the dorsal aspect of the digits from repetitive moderate stress.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hx of peripheral arterial disease.Ulcers secondary to arterial insufficiency are located on the distal margins of the foot and are frequently gangrenous or 'punched out' in appearance.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Non-invasive vascular studies may help to exclude peripheral arterial disease, although wounds of mixed aetiology are not uncommon.A Doppler-derived ankle-brachial index &lt;0.92 is abnormal. If foot pulses are absent or diminished, the ankle-brachial index is &lt;0.8 and the patient has foot or leg ulcers.More detailed arterial imaging such as duplex arterial ultrasound can be performed to document the level and degree of arterial obstruction.</p>",
