"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In appendicitis, rectal bleeding is not present.Patients with appendicitis may describe abdominal pain that has migrated from a periumbilical position to the right lower quadrant.The abdominal pain of intussusception is more colicky than the abdominal pain that is commonly described in appendicitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The findings of an intussusception mass and 'target sign' or other characteristic signs will be absent on ultrasound examination if appendicitis in present. Ultrasound has value in the detection of appendicitis, although clinical experience dictates that the use of ultrasound is highly operator-dependent, and that the false-negative rate is quite high in young children, particularly those in the age group for intussusception.CT may be helpful in identifying appendicitis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Gastroenteritis involves episodes of vomiting that are typically non-bilious, often in association with anorexia, fever, lethargy, and diarrhoea.Rectal bleeding is absent in gastroenteritis, except in the presence of invasive organisms such as Salmonella or Shigella.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The findings of an intussusception mass and characteristic signs will be absent on ultrasound examination if an infant presents with gastroenteritis.Plain abdominal films may show dilated small- and large-bowel loops.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> UTI may present with fever, foul-smelling urine, lethargy, frequent urination, painful urination, anorexia, and vomiting, and in fact may be easily confused with intussusception or gastroenteritis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain films may reveal an ileus pattern; CT may show evidence of pyelonephritis in advanced cases; ultrasound may be normal.Urinalysis and culture establish the diagnosis.</p>",
