"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Haemoptysis may occur.Shortness of breath (SOB) is a more common symptom, often related to a history of smoking.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR or chest CT scan frequently demonstrates a single pulmonary lesion, often in the central bronchial region, in people with lung cancer.Multiple lesions on CXR or chest CT scan more likely in people with MBC. [29]Biopsy of the lesion consistent with lung or breast primary.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More likely to present in younger patients.Usually affects weight-bearing bones (e.g., femur), whereas the ribs are a common site for bony metastases in MBC.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A single bone lesion, rather than multiple, on bone scan, with or without PET.Biopsy may be necessary if a single lesion is present, to determine tumour origin.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Much less common than MBC.More likely: to have a history of radiation to the breast; for lesion to develop within the irradiated area; for there to have been a tumour-free-interval of at least 5 years after end of radiotherapy. [30]Unlike radiation-induced breast sarcoma, the risk of breast carcinoma relapse is highest in the first 2 to 3 years after surgery. [31]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging is generally not helpful.Biopsy with pathological evaluation is required.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain metastases from MBC often demonstrate ring enhancement on CT and MRI, whereas primary neoplasms of the brain generally do not demonstrate this effect. [32]More likely to present on imaging as a single brain lesion rather than multiple lesions.Brain oedema is common with glioblastoma, a form of primary brain cancer.</p>",
