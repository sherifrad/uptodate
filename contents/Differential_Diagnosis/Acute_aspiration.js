"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Wheezing is paroxysmal and intermittent and usually diffuse. It decreases after bronchodilators, is polyphonic, and is characterised by many different pitches. Cough is triggered by exercise, cold, sleep, and allergens. Patient may have hx and/or FHx of atopy or asthma. [39]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary function tests usually show reversible obstructive ventilatory impairment. [39]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Wheezing presents early in life, with accompanying poor weight gain, diarrhoea, and recurrent sinus and pulmonary infections. Nasal examination may reveal polyps. Cough is productive and wet, suggesting a suppurative process such as bronchiectasis. Patient may have FHx of bronchiectasis. [39]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sweat chloride test shows elevated level of chloride. Chest x-ray may reveal bronchiectasis, but CT scan is more sensitive. [40]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and right upper quadrant discomfort may be features. Sputum, if present, is usually frothy. Fever is usually absent.

Pulsus alternans, characterised by evenly spaced strong and weak peripheral pulses, is pathognomonic of severe left ventricular failure. [41]  [42]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest x-ray may reveal enlarged pulmonary vessels, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary oedema; the infiltrates improve quickly after diuresis.Brain natriuretic peptide &gt;100 nanograms/L (&gt;100 picograms/mL) makes a diagnosis of heart failure with sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 76%, and predictive accuracy of 83%.
