"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset in infancy. No associated atopy. Associated with maternal smoking. Retrospective diagnosis made once the child has left the infantile age range.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Non-atopic result on skin prick testing may provide supportive evidence, but this is not definitive. Causes include respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses. [15]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of sudden onset of symptoms such as cough, wheeze, or choking is suggestive. Differential air entry or wheeze exists on auscultation. Chronic symptoms include recurrent episodes of wheeze.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Inspiratory and expiratory chest radiographs may reveal asymmetry of chest expansion due to the 'ball-valve' mechanism of the foreign body. Chronic changes include collapse and consolidation distal to the obstruction.Bronchoscopy is necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis and retrieval of the foreign body.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of vomiting may be present. Gastro-oesophageal reflux and swallowing incoordination are risk factors. Focal signs of pneumonitis or pneumonia may be present on examination acutely during episodes. Chronic aspiration may be complicated by development of bronchiectasis (suggested clinically by localised crepitations, decreased air entry, and clubbing).",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sweat test: sweat chloride 60 mmol/L or greater (60 mEq/L or greater) on repeat samples is diagnostic (levels of 40-59 mmol/L should be considered as indeterminate and suspicious). [49]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Paradoxic adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration resulting in high-pitched inspiratory stridor and dyspnoea that may be misinterpreted as wheeze. An expiratory component may be present. Typically loudest over the central airways. May be spontaneous or exercise-induced.",
