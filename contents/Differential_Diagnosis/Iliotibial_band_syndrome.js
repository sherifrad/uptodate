With the patient lying flat and the knee held at about 30&deg; of flexion, the shin is shifted to the medial side. Insufficiency of the LCL will allow the knee to 'open up' excessively. The test is repeated with the leg straight. If the knee still opens up excessively, then more than just the LCL is torn.",
