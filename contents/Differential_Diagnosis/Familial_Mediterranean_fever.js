"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dutch and other European ancestry. Autosomal recessive.Disease onset is typically in infancy.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Targeted genetic analysis will show mutation in the MVK gene, which regulates the function of the protein mevalonate kinase. [29]  [43]  [44]  [45]  [46]Serum IgD may be elevated.

Autosomal dominant or sporadic.Attacks typically last days to weeks and include migratory macules, patches, papules, and plaques; migratory myalgia; periorbital oedema; pleurisy; conjunctivitis; scrotal pain. Amyloidosis occurs in 10%.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Targeted genetic analysis will show mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene, which regulates the protein TNFRSF1A. [29]  [43]  [44]  [45]  [46]Serum levels of soluble TNF receptor are reduced. [45]  However, this is not sensitive or specific, has high variability of results, and is only available in specialised and research laboratories.The associated immunophenotype of cutaneous lesions is characterised by an infiltrate of CD68+ (monocytes), CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells (T cells).Immunofluorescence studies of lesional skin reveal IgM and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction; diffuse IgA, IgG, and C3 deposition; and fibrinogen in the upper dermis.
