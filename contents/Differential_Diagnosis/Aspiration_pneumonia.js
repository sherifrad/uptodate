"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs immediately after the precipitating event.Clinically difficult to distinguish. Symptoms persist beyond the initial 24 hours. Similar pulmonary signs are seen such as coughing, wheezing, cyanosis, hypoxaemia, pulmonary oedema, respiratory distress, or gastric contents in oropharynx.Cardiac signs such as hypotension are also similar.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum Gram stain shows no WBCs.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Depends on the size of area of lung that is affected and speed at which lung collapse occurs. If a large area of the lung is affected with rapid onset, there is typically pain on the affected side, dyspnoea (sudden onset), and cyanosis. Slower onset of lung collapse may be asymptomatic or cause only minor symptoms. A harsh, non-productive cough is produced by gradual collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lack of leukocytosis, or other markers of active infection. CXR usually shows changes in posterior dependent aspects.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Pulmonary oedema</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with SOB, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and tachypnea. History of heart disease or fluid overload can usually be elicited.Crackles are heard on auscultation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR typically shows symmetric distribution of opacities, although may not be evident early on. Evaluation of left ventricular dysfunction by BNP and echo are helpful.Leukocytosis usually not present.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Form of aspiration pneumonia occurring acutely or chronically from aspiration of vegetable fat or mineral oil (exogenous form). There is a history of ingestion of lipid over periods of time. Acute form may present with fever and cough especially in younger patients. Chronic form may be asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT can occasionally demonstrate low attenuation areas (-30HU).</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically complain of productive cough, breathlessness, chest or abdominal pain, fever, and general malaise. Older people present with atypical symptoms including confusion, lethargy, and general deterioration.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Common organisms detected on sputum culture are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other gram-negative bacilli.Atypical organisms may be detected with appropriate testing (e.g., serology or antigen tests).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Green-yellow sputum.No difference in signs and symptoms. HAP refers to any pneumonia that develops after 72 hours of hospitalisation. This includes all types of pneumonias, including aspiration pneumonia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum culture showing growth of gram-negative rods or Staphylococcus aureus is more likely.</p>",
