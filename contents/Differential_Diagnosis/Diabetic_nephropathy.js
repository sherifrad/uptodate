"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Since both diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common disorders, patients with both conditions may or may not have DN.A diagnosis other than DN should be considered if there is a rapid progression of renal failure, evidence of another systemic disease, or short duration of diabetes (although onset is insidious in type 2, and DN may occasionally be the presenting manifestation of type 2 diabetes mellitus).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Minimal proteinuria may indicate non-diabetic kidney disease.Other specific diagnostic tests for other systemic disorders associated with non-diabetic kidney disease may be positive (e.g., serum protein electrophoresis or serum free light chains in myeloma, ANA in SLE, ANCA in vasculitis, hypocomplementaemia in SLE, cryoglobulinaemia).</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Multiple myeloma (MM) patients also may present with renal failure and proteinuria.Symptoms of bone pain and anaemia are the most common presenting features, affecting 80% of patients with MM.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The characteristic test results that differ from DN are: the presence of paraproteinaemia/paraproteinuria; hypercalcaemia; impaired production of normal immunoglobulin; and lytic bone lesions. [17]Urinalysis with sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) was classically utilised to evaluate for discrepancy between albumin and total protein, as standard urinalysis dipstick detects albumin only. SSA causes precipitation of all of the urinary proteins, including paraproteins (Bence Jones proteins).Serum protein electrophoresis (PEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP): paraprotein spike.Serum and urine free light chains: increased concentrations of free light chain in serum.Skull x-rays, CT, or MRI bone: lytic lesions.Bone marrow biopsy: plasma cell proliferation.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can be caused by stones, cancer, fibrosis, prostate hypertrophy/cancer, neurogenic bladder, or pelviureteric junction obstruction.Obstruction to urine flow can result in post-renal failure. Symptoms include trouble passing urine, anuria, oliguria, haematuria, pain (with kidney stones), and urinary leakage/incontinence.Physical examination findings include enlarged prostate on rectal examination, costovertebral angle tenderness, suprapubic tenderness, and bladder fullness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Passage of Foley catheter may result in flow of urine and relief of obstruction.Kidney ultrasound: hydronephrosis, stones.Prostate ultrasound: hypertrophy, cancer.CT abdomen: hydronephrosis, stones, mass, congenital abnormalities, fibrosis.PSA: elevated in BPH, prostate cancer.MRI: not routine but may show hydronephrosis, stones, mass, congenital abnormalities, fibrosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis and cryoglobulinaemia, is in the differential for DN.Patient presentation and physical examination may be similar to that of DN. However, there may be symptoms and signs of other systemic disease, such as rashes or joint involvement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urinalysis: haematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic red cells.Albuminuria.Positive serology (e.g., ANA, ANCA, hepatitis serology).Complement: decreased in immune glomerulonephritis (e.g., lupus).Kidney biopsy: glomerulonephritis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Renal artery stenosis presents either as HTN refractory to multiple maximised antihypertensives or as renal failure shortly after the initiation of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs).Physical examination is significant for an abdominal bruit. [18]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound, CT scan, MRI: shrunken kidney, decreased flow through the renal artery.Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): renal artery stenosis.Renal angiogram: renal artery stenosis.</p>",
