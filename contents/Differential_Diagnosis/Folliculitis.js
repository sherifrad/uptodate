"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs when hair re-enters the skin adjacent to the exit point from the hair follicle.Occurs in men of African descent or other racial groups with dark, curly hair.Inflammatory papules develop in the beard area as well as the anterior neck in men who shave regularly.The mustache area usually does not develop pseudofolliculitis barbae.Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation often persists following resolution of active lesions. Chronic pseudofolliculitis barbae can lead to development of firm papules, plaques, hypertrophic scars, and groove formation in the anterior neck and submandibular areas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The advancing end of a curved hair shaft reentering the epidermis results in a histological picture of an invagination of the epidermis.Accompanied by inflammation, and sometimes microabscess. When the hair enters the dermis, a more exuberant inflammatory response is elicited, and a foreign body giant cell reaction is formed around the tip of the hair.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can mimic folliculitis because both diseases affect the pilosebaceous unit.Although acne vulgaris is typically considered a condition of adolescence and early adulthood, it can persist later into adult life.Acne primarily affects the face, chest, shoulders, and the back. Comedones and inflammatory papules seen in acne are both follicular based.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histopathology shows infundibular dilatation and thinning of the follicular wall with a follicular plug consisting of keratinised cells and sebum. When follicular contents are released into the dermis, there is an inflammatory response mediated by neutrophils and later by histiocytes.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Alopecia mucinosa is a condition where follicular mucinosis affecting terminal hair follicles ultimately results in hair loss.Although follicular papules may be present, some cases present with only well circumscribed patch of alopecia. [14]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histology shows extensive mucin deposition within the outer root sheath and sebaceous gland epithelium, leading to reticular epithelial degeneration. [15]</p>",
