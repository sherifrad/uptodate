"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Risk factors include older parental age, bacterial vaginosis, and thrombophilias.Pregnancy loss in the first trimester is 18 times greater in patients who bleed moderately to severely.Cramp-like discomfort may signify the process of expulsion of the fetus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound findings of a complete mole are characteristically different from spontaneous abortion. A partial mole may contain a fetal pole or fetus, usually without cardiac activity, and may be more difficult to discriminate from a missed abortion.Inspection of evacuated tissue for hydropic villi, and chromosome testing of evacuated tissue may be confirmatory.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Uterus is larger than expected for dates, and there is elevated serum beta hCG with corresponding symptoms of nausea and emesis, but it is rare for molar pregnancies to be associated with multiple gestation.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with an enlarged uterus and painless bleeding of uterine and adnexal masses.The theca lutein cysts of molar pregnancies are typically a painful condition.Nausea, emesis, and hyperthyroidism are not typically seen in pelvic malignancies.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum beta hCG is rarely elevated with pelvic tumours (with the notable exception of choriocarcinoma).Ultrasound of the pelvis demonstrates uterine mass or abnormal adnexal organs.Pelvic CT generally is diagnostic.Pathology of the products of dilation and suction evacuation may confirm tumour histology.</p>",
