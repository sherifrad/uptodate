"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with systolic left-sided or biventricular congestive heart failure will often have a history of heart failure. Underlying diastolic heart failure may be under-recognised.Physical examination may note signs consistent with heart failure, such as an elevated jugular venous pressure, extra heart sounds, coarse breath sounds with crackles above the lung bases, and dependent pitting oedema. [128]  It may be difficult to distinguish heart failure, particularly left-sided heart failure, from an acute exacerbation of COPD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest imaging may show an enlarged heart and/or pleural effusions. An elevated B-type natriuretic peptide is often present. [129]  [130]  An echocardiogram may be used to determine cardiac function.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Pneumonia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Many aspects of acute exacerbations including dyspnoea, cough, and sputum production may be found in patients with pneumonia and it is often not possible to differentiate without chest imaging.About 10% to 15% of patients presenting with an apparent acute exacerbation are found to have pneumonia, or other abnormalities, defined by chest imaging. [131]  [132]  [133]  Patients with pneumonia have in general been found to experience higher fevers, more acute onset of illness, and somewhat greater severity of acute illness when compared with COPD patients without pneumonia. [131]  [134]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest imaging in patients with pneumonia should identify changes consistent with an infiltrative process in the lung parenchyma.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Pleural effusion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pleural effusions may exacerbate dyspnoea in patients with COPD. Physical examination may demonstrate decreased or absent breath sounds with dullness to percussion related to a pleural effusion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest imaging is recommended.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Pneumothorax</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with COPD found to have pneumothoraces may or may not have additional signs or symptoms suggestive of a respiratory tract infection, but their presentation may closely mirror that of an acute exacerbation. Decreased breath sounds may be identified on the affected side and tracheal deviation away from the affected side and/or hypotension may be present in patients with a tension pneumothorax.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest imaging is recommended to exclude a possible pneumothorax in patients with more than mild episodes. [135]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically, pulmonary embolism may present with signs and symptoms similar to an acute exacerbation of COPD, and the two are difficult to distinguish. [136]  Pulmonary embolism should be considered as a cause of the acute symptoms if no other identifiable trigger for the exacerbation is evident. Persons with prior thrombo-embolic disease or underlying malignancy may be at particular risk. [136]A low systolic blood pressure and/or the inability to increase the PaO2 &gt;60 mmHg with oxygen may indicate the presence of a pulmonary embolism.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary embolus may be diagnosed using D-dimer assay, spiral computed tomography angiogram, or pulmonary angiography in patients with COPD. Test selection should be based on local expertise. Dopplers of the lower extremities may be considered to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically, may be difficult to distinguish. Chest pain may be more apparent, with radiation down left side. Nausea, jaw pain, and/or diaphoresis may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An electrocardiogram should be performed for patients who may require hospitalisation for care of an acute exacerbation of COPD, to identify possible cardiac ischaemia and arrhythmias. [46]</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differentiating features may include palpitations, light-headedness, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An electrocardiogram should be performed for patients who may require hospitalisation for care of an acute exacerbation of COPD or who are experiencing palpitations or dizziness, to identify possible cardiac ischaemia and arrhythmias. [46]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Inappropriate oxygen therapy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> While oxygen therapy is clearly indicated for many patients with COPD and acute exacerbations, excessive oxygen leads to further degradation of the patient's respiratory physiology. Exposure to oxygen leads to decrease of hypoxic vasoconstriction of arteries supplying poorly ventilated spaces, increasing the degree of V/Q mismatch and/or intrapulmonary shunt. [137]  [138]  An excess of oxygen may also decrease the capacity of erythrocytes to carry CO2 (Haldane effect). [139]  These changes may then result in worsening of the patient's hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An ABG should be performed for patients who are hypoxaemic or are receiving oxygen therapy who present with an apparent acute exacerbation of COPD.</p>",
