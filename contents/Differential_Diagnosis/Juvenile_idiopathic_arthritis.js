"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with single joint involvement, high fevers, severe pain and/or erythematous joints.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Synovial fluid analysis demonstrates the presence of bacteria, elevated white blood cells and positive cultures.Radionucleotide bone scintigraphy shows increased uptake in the affected joint.MRI shows synovial enhancement and effusion and marrow oedema of the adjacent bone in cases of accompanying osteomyelitis. Significant synovial thickening is more likely to be associated with inflammatory arthritis.Synovial fluid may be sterile in cases where reactive effusions are present secondary to juxta-articular osteomyelitis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with high fevers, severe pain and/or focal tenderness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Synovial fluid analysis may demonstrate the presence of bacteria, elevated white blood cells and positive cultures when there is involvement of the joint. Synovial fluid may be sterile in cases where reactive effusions are present secondary to juxta-articular osteomyelitis.Radionucleotide bone scintigraphy shows increased uptake in the bone.MRI shows abnormal diffuse marrow signal which is best seen on T1-weighted MRI images. However, it should be noted that false-negative MRI results may be observed early in the course of infection.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Acute rheumatic fever</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents as an acute, migratory arthritis that responds well to NSAIDs. Features include continuous fever, cardiac involvement and/or erythema marginatum rashes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Throat cultures positive for group A streptococcus; positive rapid streptococcal antigen test and/or elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titres.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with non-erosive polyarthritis, malar rashes, renal involvement and/or photosensitivity. Serositis and CNS involvement are also suggestive of SLE.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> High titre ANA and other autoantibodies (such as anti ds-DNA, SS-A, SS-B, Smith, RNP) may be present.Urinalysis may be abnormal, showing blood and/or protein.Low levels of complements C3 and/or C4.FBC may show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and (autoimmune haemolytic) anaemia.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Juvenile dermatomyositis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with muscle weakness, muscle pain and/or characteristic rashes such as Gottron's papules, linear extensor erythema or heliotrope rash.Polyarticular non-erosive arthritis is usually present, especially in early stages of disease. The polyarthritis usually responds to treatment of the underlying myositis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abnormal muscle-derived enzymes such as lactose dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, creatinine kinase and aldolase may be present.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with high persistent fevers which do not normalise for several days, polymorphous rash, involvement of lips and conjunctiva, oedema of extremities and/or desquamation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Demonstration of coronary artery enlargement or aneurysms is suggestive of Kawasaki disease.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Pigmented villonodular synovitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with recurrent, painless swelling in one knee, ankle or tendon sheath. Usually associated with slow, progressive destruction of cartilage with bone erosion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Synovial fluid analysis shows blood-stained, dark brown fluid.MRI shows low signal density on T1- and T2-weighted studies.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Synovial haemangiomas</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is usually no morning stiffness and treatment with NSAIDs does not result in improvement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI may show absence of synovial fluid and vascular elements and enhancement.</p>",

"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with activity-related pain, occasional recurrent bland effusions and/or localised tenderness on examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays may show sub-chondral fractures.MRI may demonstrate cartilaginous separation and can also be used in lesion staging.</p>",
