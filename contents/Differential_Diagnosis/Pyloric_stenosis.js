"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Emesis similar to that in pyloric stenosis may occur after feeding but is not forceful, and it is usually small in volume and effortless. The emesis can rarely contain blood.GORD can lead to failure to thrive, chronic lung disease, oesophagitis, and oesophageal strictures. [41]  Symptoms usually begin by 6 weeks of life but resolve by 2 years of age. [42]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Barium swallow and radionuclide scan may show oesophageal reflux, and endoscopy may show superficial oesophageal ulcerations or inflamed mucosa. [41]  Overnight oesophageal pH monitoring showing low pH is the diagnostic standard.Electrolytes are usually normal, although chloride may be slightly depressed due to emesis. [43]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Infants will not have difficulty gaining weight.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Can be determined by estimating appropriate feeding volumes and comparing them with actual volumes.Chemistry panel and ultrasonographic measurements of pyloric muscle thickness and channel length will be normal.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Many cases present in adulthood. [44]The key symptom is bilious emesis, unlike non-bilious emesis seen in pyloric stenosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Upper GI fluoroscopic contrast study will show duodenojejunal junction not crossing mid-line. If the mid-gut is volvulated around its mesentery, the classic corkscrew appearance of contrast flowing to the jejunum will be seen. [44]</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Diarrhoea generally follows vomiting. Diarrhoea is seldom seen in pyloric stenosis, which usually presents with constipation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Infants with infectious diarrhoea can have severe volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances similar to those seen in pyloric stenosis.Stool cultures may show Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, or Shigella.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Food allergy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical features are vomiting and diarrhoea for the first 3 months of life.Bloody diarrhoea can be seen due to the development of allergic colitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In addition to dietary history, diagnosis is based on exclusion of allergic agents.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically, diagnosed after a long period of symptoms. Diagnosis can occur up to 5 years of age.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Barium upper GI imaging is diagnostic in 90% of patients, showing double bulb (normal duodenal bulb and proximal antral chamber between the web and the pylorus). [45]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Seen in neonates.Bilious emesis is seen in 85% of patients, as most atresias are distal to the ampulla of Vater. [44]  Pyloric stenosis patients present with non-bilious projectile emesis.One third of infants with this diagnosis have Down's syndrome.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Antenatal ultrasound may show polyhydramnios, fluid-filled stomach, and proximal duodenum.Classic sign is a double bubble on an abdominal x-ray. [44]</p>",
