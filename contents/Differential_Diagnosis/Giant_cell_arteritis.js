"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical symptoms of PMR include aching and stiffness in the shoulders and proximal limb muscles, with or without mild polyarthritis or tenosynovitis. Although GCA and PMR frequently co-exist, cranial symptoms including headache, jaw claudication, and vision symptoms are typically absent in patients with PMR. PMR typically has less prominent symptoms than GCA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No specific diagnostic tests, but diagnosis is supported by history, physical examination, and raised inflammatory markers (ESR &gt;40 mm/hour). A rapid response to oral corticosteroids makes the diagnosis more likely.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar in solid-organ cancers and haematological malignancies, especially multiple myeloma and lymphoma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A thorough physical examination, including careful breast exam should be performed as well as age-appropriate cancer screening studies (e.g., mammogram). Haematological studies including protein electrophoresis, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, and bone marrow biopsy may reveal evidence of multiple myeloma. CXR and CT may reveal enlarged nodes in lymphoma.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Takayas's arteritis (TA)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The major factors differentiating TA from GCA are age at disease onset and lack of involvement of cranial arteries. Typically occurs in young women, usually in their 20s and 30s. Although systemic symptoms are also common in TA, cranial symptoms are usually absent. Patients with TA often have absent or asymmetric peripheral pulses and multiple arterial bruits.Occasional mild, chronic TA may not be diagnosed until after the patient is 50 years old. They may have had longstanding symptoms of decreased aortic or aortic branch outflow, such as dizzy spells, or been noted as having an unexplained lack of a pulse in one arm.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Aortic arch or other targeted angiography, CT, or magnetic resonance angiography.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may not be any differentiating signs or symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Investigations depend on the infection being considered. These include multiple blood cultures and echocardiography for infective endocarditis, CXR and sputum culture for TB, and serological tests for other chronic infections including hepatitis B and C.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symmetric small joint polyarthritis and extra-articular manifestations are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis and distinguish this condition from GCA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> May have positive RF and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. May have radiographic, ultrasound, or MRI evidence of joint erosions.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Amyloidosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Amyloidosis can rarely cause jaw and tongue claudication, although these are very characteristic of GCA. [25]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum immunoelectrophoresis may show a monoclonal band. Amyloidosis is distinguishable from GCA by lack of response to therapy and by staining of a temporal artery specimen for amyloid. Rectal or abdominal fat biopsy and serum amyloid P scan may be positive.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms may mimic GCA. The presence of other symptoms (e.g., PMR, headache, and jaw claudication) in the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory markers clearly distinguishes GCA from NAION.",
