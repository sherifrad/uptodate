"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patient will typically be a male endurance athlete without cardiac symptoms.No family history of HCM or sudden death.Hypertrophy will regress with cessation of exercise. [40]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echocardiography: will characteristically show increased LV chamber dimension (LV end-diastolic dimension or LV end-diastolic &gt;55 mm), symmetric LVH with a homogeneous-appearing myocardium.Wall thicknesses may occasionally exceed upper normal limits (12 mm). [40]LV filling pattern is most often normal. [40]The use of late gadolinium enhancement techniques may aid in differentiating HCM from an athletic heart. [21]</p>",
