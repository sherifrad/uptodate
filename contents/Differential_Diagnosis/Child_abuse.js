"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Family history of easy bleeding following dental extractions or postoperatively. Other presentations include prolonged epistaxis or bleeding from umbilical cord stump.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Type I (mild) and type IV (moderate-to-severe) OI: recurrent fractures in infancy and childhood; associated with dentinogenesis (discoloured teeth) and joint laxity. Type 1 has associated blue sclera.Type II (lethal) and type III (severe, progressively deforming) OI: easily diagnosed clinically and radiologically due to the severity.There may be a family history of the disease or of recurrent fractures, deafness, or hernias.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-ray reveals wormian bones, reduced bone density, and evidence of multiple fractures.Genetic testing is possible in a few centres, but expensive. Genetic testing is only recommended in types II and IV; other types are diagnosed clinically and radiologically. [49]</p>",
