"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common in children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years.Results in severe dehydration and even death.The incubation period for rotavirus disease is approximately 2 days. The disease is characterised by vomiting and watery diarrhoea for 3-8 days, and fever and abdominal pain occur frequently.  [57]Affected children are frequently simultaneously infected with both respiratory and GI viruses, making interpretation of these findings more difficult.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ELISA and latex agglutination test on stool samples will be positive for rotavirus.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Defined as loose (mush) or watery stools without pain occurring in at least 75% of stools for a period of at least 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.Does not result in weight loss.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Autoimmune process resulting from an inappropriate immune response to the dietary protein gluten.Wide range of symptoms, including gas, recurring abdominal bloating and pain, chronic diarrhoea or constipation; pale, foul-smelling or fatty stool, weight loss/weight gain, fatigue, unexplained anaemia, behavioural changes, irritability common in children; tingling numbness in the legs (from nerve damage); bone or joint pain, muscle cramps; delayed growth in children or failure to thrive in infants; aphthous ulcers, dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis (especially at a young age), iron deficiency. [58]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Test for serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies. A positive IgA tTG result should prompt small bowel biopsy with at least 4 tissue samples to confirm the diagnosis.Adherence to a gluten-free diet may eliminate symptoms within a few months.

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset between ages 15 and 40.Almost always involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon. Symptoms vary from intermittent rectal bleeding associated with the passage of mucus to frequent loose, bloody stools.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy and biopsy: vascular markings are lost due to engorgement of the mucosa, giving it an erythematous appearance. In addition, petechiae, exudates, touch friability, and frank haemorrhage may be present. Colonic involvement is continuous. More severe cases may be associated with macroulcerations, profuse bleeding, and copious exudates.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset between ages 15 and 40.May involve the entire GI tract from mouth to perianal area. Fatigue, prolonged diarrhoea with abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever, with or without gross bleeding, are the hallmarks of Crohn's disease.Although Hemoccult-positive stools are common in Crohn's disease, gross bleeding is much less frequent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy and biopsy: focal ulcerations adjacent to areas of normal-appearing mucosa along with polypoid mucosal changes that give a cobblestone appearance. Skip areas of involvement are typical with segments of normal-appearing bowel interrupted by large areas of obvious disease; this pattern is different from the continuous involvement in ulcerative colitis. Pseudopolyps are also often present.</p>",
