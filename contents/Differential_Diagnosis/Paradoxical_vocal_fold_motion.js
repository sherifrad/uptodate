"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Variable severity and periodicity of cough, expiratory wheeze, dyspnoea, hyper-secretions, chest tightness, and tachypnoea.Symptoms show reversibility.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Spirometry: measurement of FEV1 and FVC. Ratio of FEV1/FVC is reduced (expressed as a percentage) indicating airway obstruction.PEFR: reduced, most markedly on waking, and improving through the morning. Compared against predicted value based on gender, age, and height.Bronchodilator challenge: reversibility of airflow obstruction with inhaled beta-2 agonist. Improvement of FEV1 or PEFR of 20% or greater following inhalation of salbutamol is diagnostic.Methacholine provocation test: airway hyper-responsiveness leading to narrowing of the bronchi and subsequent reduced FEV1 in response to inhaled methacholine (bronchoconstrictor).</p>",
