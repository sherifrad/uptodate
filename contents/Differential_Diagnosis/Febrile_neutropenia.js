"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Drug fevers are typically high fevers that are often cyclical in nature.Drug fevers may be associated with an eosinophilia, acute interstitial nephritis, or drug-induced hepatitis.They should improve with discontinuation of the offending agent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: eosinophilia.Culture: negative.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Progression of the underlying malignancy can be associated with tissue necrosis and inflammation that can yield low-grade or high fevers that do not improve with antibiotics. However, patients with haematological malignancies often present with diurnal fevers.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There are no specific laboratory tests to indicate a tumour fever.Cultures: negative.Imaging may demonstrate progression of disease. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion when fevers persist, despite negative cultures and broad antibiotic coverage.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Malignancy is a risk factor for thrombosis, which can cause fever, especially in the setting of compromised blood flow to tissue with associated necrosis.Signs or symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis with extremity pain, erythema, or swelling may be present.Additionally, signs or symptoms of a pulmonary embolism may be present with shortness of breath, tachycardia, chest pain, hypoxaemia, and cerebral embolism with new neurological signs or symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Doppler ultrasounds, CT angiograms of the chest and/or brain, and echocardiograms (either trans-thoracic or trans-oesophageal) will reveal the presence of a thrombus or thromboembolic disease.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Paraneoplastic syndromes</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Many malignancies are associated with the development of paraneoplastic syndromes, which are characterised by the development of auto-antibodies, presumed to have developed in response to tumour antigens. The resultant syndromes can mimic the known autoimmune syndromes. In addition, there are a number of paraneoplastic syndromes that affect the nervous system and are well characterised and associated with particular underlying malignancies.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There is a paraneoplastic syndrome antibody panel that can be sent to from the peripheral blood and/or the cerebral spinal fluid. If positive, these are helpful as they are specific. They are not sensitive, however, and their absence does not rule out a paraneoplastic syndrome.</p>",
