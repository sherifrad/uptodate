"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> It is often not easy to differentiate between pathogens that cause bloody diarrhoea.Bloody diarrhoea is suspicious for Shigella or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli.Other bacterial infections such as Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Salmonella may also cause bloody diarrhoea. [2]Watery diarrhoea often occurs with V cholerae.Clostridium difficile may rarely cause bloody diarrhoea. If risk factors such as previous antibiotic therapy or exposure are present, C difficile should be considered.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool cultures are useful to differentiate bacterial causes of diarrhoea.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Viral causes of diarrhoea (such as norovirus, adenovirus, and rotavirus) do not usually cause bloody diarrhoea. In addition, vomiting tends to be a significant feature of these infections. [2]",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In developing countries, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cyclospora cayetanensis commonly cause diarrhoeal disease. [2]Parasitic diarrhoea in the developed world is uncommon and may be related to exposure during travel.Except in E histolytica infection, diarrhoea is not usually bloody.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The course of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis) is often more protracted than that of shigellosis. [4]  There may be a hx or FHx of the disease. Extra-intestinal manifestations of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease may be present (e.g., skin lesions or fistulae).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Negative stool cultures and positive sigmoidoscopy findings suggest inflammatory bowel disease.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Persistent (&gt;14 days) diarrhoea may prompt consideration of celiac disease. However, the diarrhoea is not bloody.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive celiac serology is diagnostic. If there is clinical suspicion, duodenal biopsy may be indicated after a gluten challenge.</p>",
