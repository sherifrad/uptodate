"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Recurrent vomiting in the absence of other symptoms, with normal examination and growth.Regurgitation is more common after meals, and when the infant is in a recumbent position.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No diagnostic tests are required.Caregiver education and reassurance should be offered.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Bilious vomiting.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Upper GI contrast study may be used to demonstrate abnormal anatomy.Abdominal ultrasound can demonstrate abnormal orientation of superior mesenteric vessels.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Intermittent intussusception</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vomiting and abdominal pain may be associated with pallor and passage of 'redcurrant jelly' stools.Abdominal mass may be palpable.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abdominal ultrasound demonstrates telescoping of the bowel wall.Air enema demonstrates telescoping of bowel and may be therapeutic.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vomiting may be preceded by abdominal distension and constipation.A history of constipation back to neonatal period is usually reported, and there may have been delayed passage of meconium.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Rectal biopsy demonstrates absence of ganglionic cells.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute change in bowel habit, and/or onset of vomiting.May have had exposure to people with similar symptoms, recent foreign travel, or recent dietary change.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Faecal sample for virology studies, microscopy, and culture help to identify causative organism.Faecal-reducing substances are positive in lactose intolerance secondary to infective gastroenteritis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms of severe GORD associated with atopy.Failure to respond to acid-suppression therapy. [10]Difficult to distinguish from GORD, and is consequently found in 10% children undergoing endoscopy for investigation of severe reflux. [10]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy shows inflammatory changes of oesophageal mucosa, with predominantly eosinophilic infiltrate.</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vomiting associated with altered alertness, change in head circumference, bulging fontanel, splayed sutures, and 'sun setting' of the eyes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cranial ultrasound as initial test for rapid assessment, followed by CT or MRI to guide neurosurgical management.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Subdural haematoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vomiting associated with altered level of alertness.Other signs of non-accidental injury such as bruising should be sought.",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Intracranial mass lesion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vomiting associated with altered level of alertness, seizures, or abnormal neurological examination.Signs of hydrocephalus may be evident.",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vomiting and altered feeding are more acute in nature.Associated with fever, tachypnoea, tachycardia, altered level of consciousness (increased irritability or lethargy), bulging fontanel, rash, high-pitched cry.Signs of otitis media include tense, bulging tympanic membrane, but this can be difficult to visualise in small infants.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Differentiating tests depend on severity and type of symptoms, and age at presentation.Diagnostic tests include FBC with differential, blood cultures, blood sugar, blood lactate, inflammatory markers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, baseline renal and liver function, urinalysis plus culture, lumbar puncture with CSF virology, microscopy, and culture where indicated.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Metabolic conditions</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Considered when symptoms begin after mild illness and period of decreased oral intake.Prolonged jaundice in neonate should be investigated for galactosaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tests include serum amino acid profile, lactate and ammonia, urinary organic acid profile.Gal-1-PUT (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase) assay in galactosaemia.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Renal failure</a></dt>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have history of abnormal renal scans prenatally, or family history of renal disease.May appear anaemic and yellow-tinged.Renal masses may be palpable.Hypertension may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Renal function tests, blood gas to check pH and bicarbonate levels.Urinalysis shows haematuria and/or proteinuria.Renal ultrasound scan shows small kidney size, presence of obstruction/hydronephrosis, or kidney stones.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Poisoning</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually more acute presentation.Vomiting may be associated with altered consciousness level, seizures, or altered neurological examination.Social history, to include living environment, exposure to hazardous materials, and contact with medications in the home, may reveal source of poison.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dictated by history and possible poison.May include blood tests to check for pancytopenia, altered liver and renal function, toxin levels.ECG may be indicated to identify arrhythmias.Further investigation/management as advised by Poisons Unit.</p>",
