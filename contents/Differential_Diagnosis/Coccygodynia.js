"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is relieved by sitting.Pain and/or tenderness may involve the sacrum or lumbar spine, without specific tenderness of the coccyx.No pain or tenderness on palpation of coccyx or rectal examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Injection of corticosteroid around the dorsal surface of the coccyx does not relieve pain, indicating pain is referred.MRI of lumbosacral spine may reveal the site of degenerative disc disease or disc herniation.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dynamic lateral sacrococcygeal x-ray may be normal and show neither the sacrococcygeal hypermobility (&gt;20&deg; on sitting) nor subluxation.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Also known as puborectal syndrome, levator spasm, or pelvic floor myalgia.This category may include some cases of idiopathic coccygodynia. [22]Dull ache or pressure sensation in the rectum, exacerbated by prolonged sitting or supine position, which may last hours to days.Tenderness of puborectalis muscle on rectal examination. [5]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anorectal manometry may show increased pressure; however, this test is controversial.Although some studies have shown increased anal canal pressure and correlated pain relief with a decrease in pressure, other authors have discouraged its routine use, citing unreliability in its diagnostic and predictive value.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Also known as pudendal canal syndrome or pudendal nerve entrapment.Unilateral or bilateral burning, prickling, stabbing, or numbness in the perineum, external genitalia, or scrotum.Pain is worse with sitting and there is a sense of a foreign object in the urethra, rectum, or vagina. [5]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is essentially clinical.MRI reveals normal anatomy, or intercurrent disease unrelated to the diagnosis, or occasionally may reveal a nerve sheath tumour.Pudendal nerve motor latency studies (nerve conduction studies) are usually normal, as sensory fibres are affected preferentially.Diagnostic nerve block, consisting of anaesthetic infiltration within the pudendal canal, results in pain relief for the duration of anaesthesia, but may be technique dependent.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Digital rectal examination reveals weak pelvic floor and lack of coccygeal tenderness. Inspection reveals the anus descending below the level of the coccyx.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI rules out lumbosacral pathology as evidenced by degenerative disc disease and/or disc herniation, or, less commonly, tumour or Tarlov cyst.Magnetic resonance neurography may reveal increased signal in proximal sciatic nerve. [25]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Contrast CT or MRI of the sacrum and pelvis will reveal an abscess cavity and/or fistula tract.WBC, CRP, and ESR may be elevated.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI of the sacrum reveals nerve root cysts of CSF density, bright on T2 weighted sequences.CT may reveal enlargement of the sacral foramina or thinning of the sacral lamina around the cyst.May or may not fill on contrast myelography.No relief of pain on coccygeal injection with corticosteroid.</p>",
