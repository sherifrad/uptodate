"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Commonly presents with amaurosis fugax and gradual or sudden visual loss. View imageVision may be poor, intraocular pressure may be abnormally high or low, and anterior segment neovascularisation is a common feature. [52]Commonly unilateral, predominantly haemorrhagic, and often involves equatorial and anterior retina rather than the posterior pole.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Fluorescein angiography shows delayed arterial filling in affected eyes.Doppler imaging may show carotid stenosis and ophthalmic artery flow reversal.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically occurs in people with a history of radiation exposure and without diabetes. View imageSigns of an irregular pattern of capillary leakage and non-perfusion are present.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically produces acute visual loss in one eye, and retinal signs (i.e., haemorrhage, cotton wool spots, macular oedema, neovascularisation) are limited to the eye and to the territory of the occlusion.Central retinal vein occlusion typically involves the posterior pole, View image but if a branch vein is occluded, signs are limited to the segment of retina drained by the vein, and it is usually possible to identify the point of occlusion where an artery crosses anterior to a vein.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Fluorescein angiography is effective in characterising the distinctly localised nature of vascular abnormality in retinal venous occlusion.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Systolic and diastolic pressures are markedly elevated.Associated with acute visual disturbance, with optic disc swelling (which is uncommon in diabetic retinopathy) and macular oedema often in the form of a macular exudate star.It may involve the posterior pole of both eyes, but signs of axoplasmic hold-up (i.e., cotton wool spots and optic disc oedema) tend to dominate the fundus appearance.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Fluorescein angiography reveals arteriolar non-perfusion, rather than capillary non-perfusion as in diabetic retinopathy.</p>",
