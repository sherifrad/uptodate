"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Infective endocarditis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Bacterial endocarditis infrequently progresses rapidly to septic shock or meningitis, and patients typically have a longer duration of fever prior to presentation. A new or changed heart murmur, septic emboli, immunological sequelae such as glomerulonephritis, and splenomegaly are common in endocarditis and not observed with meningococcal infections.",

"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Non-purulent conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, and erythroderma or a scarlatiniform rash that later desquamates are characteristic of TSS. GI complaints, hepatitis, severe muscle pain, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), and renal abnormalities are more common in TSS than in meningococcal infections. Focal pyogenic infections may be observed in patients with TSS, particularly those caused by staphylococci.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood cultures are positive in about half of patients with streptococcal TSS and 5% with staphylococcal TSS.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Enteroviral infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rashes are most commonly erythematous and maculopapular but may be petechial. Stomatitis is characteristic of group A Coxsackie viruses.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with enteroviral meningoencephalitis typically reveals mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, mildly elevated or normal glucose, and normal protein concentration. Enterovirus may be isolated from blood, CSF, stool, throat, or urine. Enteroviral nucleic acid may be detected in CSF.</p>",

Severe illness, with pneumonitis, chorioretinitis, enteritis, hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, coagulopathy, and pancytopenia, occurs in neonates and immunocompromised patients.",
