"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically, non-specific exanthem of rose-pink macules that spread cephalocaudally.Joint involvement is common.Tender cervical, occipital and/or posterior auricular lymphadenopathy is common. [10]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serology shows presence of anti-rubella IgM or a 4-fold increase in anti-rubella IgG antibodies. [10]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Prodrome typically includes cough, coryza and conjunctivitis.There is an exanthem consisting of grey-white papules on the buccal mucosa (Koplik's spots) during the prodrome.The exanthem is an erythematous maculopapular eruption that spreads cephalocaudally and usually begins to clear within 1 week. [10]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Virus isolation can be obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab for viral culture.Serological assay for measles IgM is also available. [10]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical prodrome of sudden high fever that lasts for 3 to 5 days.Non-specific exanthem appears at the time of defervescence.The disease usually affects younger children (6 months to 3 years) than erythema infectiosum. [11]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serological studies and PCR are all available to identify human herpesvirus type 6.Culture may be available but is rarely necessary. [11]</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically preceded by pharyngitis and fever as opposed to the relatively asymptomatic prodrome of erythema infectiosum.The eruption associated is papular (a sandpaper texture) and spreads centripetally.Other cutaneous findings include petechial streaks in skin folds (Pastia's lines) and circumoral pallor.Mucosal signs include exudative pharyngitis and a white or beefy red tongue.Rash usually followed by desquamation. [12]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cultures of oropharynx usually reveal the aetiological organism, Streptococcus pyogenes.Anti-steptolysin O (ASO) titres and anti-deoxyribonuclease-B titre (anti-DNase-B) may be helpful in the diagnosis as well. [12]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Involved area usually a unilateral plaque as opposed to the bilateral macular cheek erythema seen in erythema infectiosum.Rash commonly warm, tender and indurated.Regional lymphadenopathy is typical. [13]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Occasionally, a left shift and elevated leukocyte count will be seen.Cultures of the affected area rarely yield the aetiological organism, Streptococcus pyogenes, but ASO titres and anti-DNase-B may indicate cutaneous infection. [13]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by progressive weakness rather than true arthritis as seen in erythema infectiosum.Calcinosis is a feature not seen in erythema infectiosum.The eruption of dermatomyositis often involves the face and eyelids but often has scale, in contrast to erythema infectiosum.Photo-sensitivity, nail fold telangiectasias and a scaling eruption over the knuckles, are highly characteristic of dermatomyositis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated serum CK, aldolase, LDH and positive serum ANA often seen in dermatomyositis.Skin biopsy can also help differentiate these 2 entities.</p>",
