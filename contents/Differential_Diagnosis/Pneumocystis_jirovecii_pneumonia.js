"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset of symptoms is more rapid and acute than Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).Patients with bacterial pneumonia often have focal lung findings, purulent sputum, and chest pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest x-ray typically shows an alveolar pattern in a focal segment or lobar distribution.Bacterial pneumonia can occur with any CD4 cell count.Blood and sputum cultures may help determine aetiology.Aetiological agent is most often Streptococcus pneumoniae.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, or tissue biopsy is negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically have travel history to areas of California, Arizona, New Mexico, south-western Texas, or southern parts of Utah and Nevada.Usually present with an influenza-like syndrome, chest pain, and dyspnoea.There may be skin findings of erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Coccidioidomycosis can be diagnosed with serological testing, skin testing, culture positivity from appropriate samples, or histopathology that shows typical characteristic spherules in tissue samples. [72]Chest x-ray may show interstitial pneumonia similar to PCP but may have single or multiple nodules, thin-walled cavities, or hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. [72]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The presentation can be similar. CMV pneumonitis is usually associated with a non-productive cough and minimal findings on lung examination. [73]CMV pneumonitis is more common in HIV-negative patients than in those with HIV.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CMV pneumonitis is typically associated with CMV viraemia. Tests for diagnosis include: viral culture, serology, pp65 antigenaemia test, histopathology, and nucleic acid amplification and detection systems, most commonly PCR.Tissue biopsy with CMV-positive histology may suggest invasive disease.

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Histoplasmosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar to PCP, patients may present with several weeks of fever and malaise but there may also be weight loss.Examination findings include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and generalised lymphadenopathy. In some disseminated cases, patients can present with septicaemia, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, liver failure, or renal failure.Unlike PCP, which rarely has extrapulmonary involvement, histoplasmosis may present with skin manifestations, neurological involvement, GI involvement, and adrenal insufficiency. [74]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Culturing the organism from an appropriate source is diagnostic but can take up to 4 weeks.Serological testing is limited in immunocompromised patients, who may not make antibodies. Antigen detection from appropriate samples can be a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test; however, false positives can occur with Blastomycosis, Paracoccidioidomycosis, and Penicillium marneffei infections.Fungal staining is rapid but is not a sensitive test.
