"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are typically asymptomatic. Symptoms may occur as the cyst enlarges or ruptures.More likely in areas where species of Echinococcus have the highest prevalence (e.g., Mediterranean countries, South America, the Middle East, North Africa, some sub-Saharan African countries, China, and the Russian Federation).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasonography and abdominal CT have high sensitivity and specificity for hydatid cysts. Cysts are most commonly located in the liver and can become superinfected. [17]Typical radiographic appearance is of a calcified ring-like cyst, with septations within the cyst, and sometimes with daughter cysts present.View imageEIA can also be used for the diagnosis of hepatic echinococcosis.Aspiration is generally contraindicated if a hydatid cyst is suspected, because of the low, but real, risk of anaphylaxis. However, aspiration may occasionally be performed in patients with possible hydatid disease when the diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess remains a possibility, or when the aspiration is performed as part of the therapy. Aspiration should be undertaken only by physicians experienced in performing these procedures and in centres specialised in treating these patients. Careful examination of an aspirate of the cyst can show protoscolices or acid-fast hooklets. [17]</p>",
