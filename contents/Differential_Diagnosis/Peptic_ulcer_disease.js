"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Distinguished from peptic ulcer disease by endoscopy: shows mass or irregular ulcer.Diagnosis should be confirmed by endoscopic biopsy.May require additional imaging to diagnose and stage (e.g., ultrasound, CT, MRI).</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of heartburn or pain rising from the lower chest to the throat is typical.May have associated laryngitis, cough, and atypical chest pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Endoscopy shows absence of gastric/duodenal ulcers and, often, erosions in oesophagus.May require additional testing with ambulatory pH-metry to prove diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Diarrhoea and evidence of malabsorption are typical.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laboratory testing may show microcytic anaemia, iron deficiency, and low calcium and albumin.Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody has sensitivity and specificity of about 95% for the diagnosis. Anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin antibody tests are less accurate.Endoscopy with duodenal biopsy is the gold standard diagnostic test. Biopsy shows flattening of the villi.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG shows upwards concave ST-segment elevation globally with PR depressions.Serum troponin is mildly elevated.Chest x-ray may be normal or show a water bottle-shaped enlarged cardiac silhouette.C-reactive protein, ESR, and white blood cells are usually elevated.</p>",
