"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> SIRS can result as a non-specific finding from a host of other disease states, including postoperative recovery, trauma, burns, transplant rejection, hyperthyroidism, Addisonian crisis, blood product transfusion reactions, serum sickness, immunisations, and CNS infarction or haemorrhages.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Specific tests are directed by clinical suspicion of underlying cause.Associated medical interventions (e.g., catheterisation, surgical procedures, ventilation) can subsequently lead to superimposed infections to make sepsis a continual threat and possibility.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Myocardial infarction (MI)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms suggesting MI are central, squeezing chest pain radiating down the left arm or into the jaw. Pain may be felt in the epigastric region.Patients may present in cardiogenic shock.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ischaemic changes on ECG.Elevated CK-MB and troponin.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Acute pancreatitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with abdominal pain and hypovolaemia.There may be a history of gallstones, alcohol use, or viral infections (e.g., mumps).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated serum amylase, lipase, glucose; low calcium.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Massive pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with acute dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, and hypotension.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT pulmonary angiogram shows a filling defect in the pulmonary arteries.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Leukemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with fever, leukocytosis, anaemia, tachycardia, multi-organ dysfunction, and dyspnoea and thus meet diagnostic criteria for (suspected) sepsis.The immunocompromise may additionally facilitate development of infections or the increased clinical suspicion of undiagnosed infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsies of blood smear, bone marrow, tumour, or lymph nodes may identify neoplastic cells.Identification of a specific infectious agent is definitive in differentiating sepsis from SIRS.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Malignant hyperthermia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is a rare condition characterised by severe hyperthermia (&gt;41.1&deg;C [106&deg;F]) and muscle rigidity following administration of anaesthetic agents (e.g., succinylcholine for intubation). Lactic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, rhabdomyolysis, hypoxia, and arrhythmias may also occur. [66]Malignant hyperthermia is an inherited disorder (autosomal dominant) and a high index of suspicion is necessary if there is a positive family history. [66]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The caffeine-halothane contracture test (CHCT) is most commonly used to screen for susceptibility, as ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) identification is gaining in clinical importance. [67]The CHCT requires muscle biopsy and testing in select regional laboratories after resolution of the episode.Neither test is clinically useful to direct therapy in the acute situation.</p>",
