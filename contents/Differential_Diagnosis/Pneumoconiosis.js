"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lung biopsy does not show pathology of pneumoconiosis or increased mineral content in people with rheumatoid arthritis without pneumoconiosis.Immunological markers, such as rheumatoid factor (RF), are non-specific and may be present in patients with silicosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis without connective-tissue disease, thus are not differentiating tests. [11]  [19]Smooth rounded opacities may be seen on the CXR in people with silicosis or coal workers' pneumoconiosis who also develop rheumatoid arthritis (Caplan's syndrome). [7]  [8]  The opacities seen in Caplan's syndrome are smooth and typically golf-ball size. They differ from the opacities seen in progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), which have irregular borders. PMF may occur as coal workers' pneumoconiosis or silicosis progress. As the opacities of PMF increase in size, they may occupy the whole upper lobe and cause distortion in the lung structure.</p>",
