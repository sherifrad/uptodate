"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The tissue response to chronic candidal infection is hyperplastic in nature - in particular, in the retrocommissural area, where a more speckled to atrophic surface pattern is often present. View imageIn the immunosuppressed patient and in cases of T-cell dysfunction this finding assumes greater clinical importance, as it concerns potential malignant transformation within the speckled areas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Candidal smear is positive.Incisional biopsy and pathology may demonstrate a range of features, from a benign hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis in most circumstances, to variable degrees of dysplasia or invasive cancer less frequently. Surface Candida may be seen.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically located predominantly over the dorsum of the tongue, in contrast to the lateral and ventral surfaces, where the vast majority of oral leukoplakia are found; plaques of keratinised tissue with fissured topography are characteristic. [112]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Treponemal-specific serology tests are antigen-based tests and remain positive lifelong if current or past infection: tests include treponemal enzyme immune assay, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination, T pallidum haemaglutination, fluorescent antibody absorption tests, and immunocapture assay.Non-treponemal titres VDRL or RPR correlate with disease activity, decreasing or becoming non-reactive with effective treatment.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be able to identify a source of chronic irritation (e.g., a faulty dental restoration, an ill-fitting denture, or parafunctional habits such as bruxism or chronic cheek biting).Removal of offending trauma may lead to resolution of keratosis.",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Lichen planus</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents with reticular, atrophic, and erosive mucosal changes in a symmetrical distribution. Reticular/plaque lesions are usually asymptomatic; erosive lesions may be painful.Lichenoid lesions elsewhere on the skin may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Incisional biopsy and pathology may demonstrate characteristic superficial keratinisation, dense banded lymphocytic infiltrate within the superficial lamina propria, and liquefactive basal layer degeneration and scattered colloid bodies or apoptotic keratinocytes.Epithelial dysplasia may be a feature. Malignant transformation is well recognised; the atrophic and erosive forms are reported to have the highest rate of malignant transformation, with published rates of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus ranging from 0% to 5.3%.

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents with a lichenoid pattern of keratosis and erosive/inflammatory lesions. Most often the lesions are accompanied by radiating reticular striaform lesions; plaque-like lesions may also be seen but are less common. [114]However, in some cases, oral lesions with plaque-like configuration similar to leukoplakia may be evident in spite of quiescent disease elsewhere. [115]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ANA and antidouble-stranded DNA antibody positive.Incisional biopsy and pathology may demonstrate vacuolated keratinocytes, patchy periodic acid-Schiff-positive patches and oedema in the lamina propria, and severe or perivascular inflammatory infiltration. [116]  Direct immunofluorescence will show an uneven globular deposition of IgG, IgA, and fibrinogen along the basement membrane zone. [117]</p>",
