"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical features include cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnoea and hoarseness (if recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis). Frequently unwell-looking, short of breath, with signs of recent weight loss.Finger clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may be present but is less common in small cell lung cancer compared with NSCLC.Usually wheezing from underlying COPD or bronchial obstruction, crackles due to post-obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis or diminished breath sounds from bronchial obstruction are present unless early disease.Facial and upper extremity swelling, distended neck veins, and dilated collateral vessels may indicate compression of the superior vena cava.Features related to distant metastases (e.g., bone pain and/or pathological fractures from bony metastases; confusion, personality change, seizures, weakness, focal neurological deficits, nausea and vomiting, and headaches from brain metastases).Brachial plexus involvement can cause weakness and/or atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand and paraesthesias and/or pain in a C8/T1 distribution. Can impact the sympathetic chain causing Horner's syndrome (ptosis, meiosis and ipsilateral anhidrosis).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest often shows massive lymphadenopathy and direct mediastinal invasion, common features of small cell lung cancer.Sputum cytology is a non-invasive and relatively simple diagnostic method with high specificity but low sensitivity, and the cost may outweigh the usefulness in terms of patient management.Flexible bronchoscopy plus biopsy provides pathological confirmation of diagnosis. Endobronchial masses can be biopsied with forceps. Endobronchial brushings, washings and alveolar lavage increase the diagnostic yield. Transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy of accessible parenchymal lesions and mediastinal lymph nodes is now possible. Detection of small peripheral lesions (&lt;2 cm) is improved by use of endobronchial ultrasound.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Metastatic cancer</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms will relate to the site of the primary tumour and there may be general symptoms of pain, weight loss, malaise, cough, dyspnoea, clubbing, and focal wheezing. Physical findings may or may not be present depending on nature and stage of tumour.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest shows one or multiple nodules of variable sizes from diffuse micronodular shadows (miliary) to well-defined masses. Often irregular and often in the periphery of the lower lung zones.Sputum cytology may reveal characteristic malignant cells. Yield is higher with large endobronchial lesions or large masses.CT/MRI head, abdomen and pelvis: extrapulmonary cancers that commonly metastasise to the lung include melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, oesophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, sarcomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon, breast, kidney and testicle.PET-FDG scan shows increased uptake in nodules and at primary site. In metastatic disease, PET scan aids in the identification of the primary site and allows for appropriate staging whenever malignancy is confirmed. Certain metastatic lesions have a lower probability of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, such as renal cell carcinoma.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy shows characteristic malignant cells. Bronchoscopy has a 100% yield for endobronchial lesions.CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) can reveal characteristic malignant cells in some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy. Pneumothorax complicates 20% to 30% of procedures. The choice between bronchoscopy and TTNA is based on lesion size, location, risks, and local expertise.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical and radiological features of bronchitis or pneumonia should improve with appropriate treatment.Recurrent pneumonia or bronchitis in a smoker or former smoker should raise the suspicion of lung cancer.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT imaging can be helpful to evaluate pulmonary masses that might not be well visualised with chest x-ray.Bronchoscopy can also be used to assess for endobronchial lesions or biopsy suspicious pulmonary masses.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Organising pneumonia (cryptogenic organising pneumonia or bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Normally presents as an influenza-like illness followed by a second illness lasting 1 to 4 months, with low-grade fever, non-productive cough, malaise, dyspnoea, and weight loss. Sometimes features pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.In most patients, auscultation reveals fine, dry lung crepitations. Finger clubbing is unusual.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest is preferable to plain chest x-ray as it gives a better assessment of the disease pattern and distribution and potential sites for biopsy. Typical features include patchy 'ground-glass' opacities in a subpleural and/or peribronchovascular distribution; thickening of bronchial walls and cylindrical dilatation; 3-5 mm diameter centrilobular nodules or other ill-defined nodules; mediastinal lymphadenopathy; pleural effusions.Pulmonary function tests typically show a restrictive pattern.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) shows a mixed cell pattern, with an increase in lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, foamy macrophages and occasional plasma cells. CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio is decreased. Also, the ratio of lymphocytes to CD8+ cells is significantly increased.Transbronchial lung biopsy, in combination with BAL can be a useful approach, prior to possible open biopsy.Open lung biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Pulmonary tuberculosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough longer than 2 to 3 weeks, discoloured or bloody sputum, night sweats and weight loss, loss of appetite, pleuritic chest pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest x-ray: primary disease commonly presents as middle and lower lung zone infiltrates. Ipsilateral adenopathy, atelectasis from airway compression and pleural effusion can be seen. Reactivation-type (post-primary) pulmonary TB usually involves apical and/or posterior segment of right upper lobe, apicoposterior segment of left upper lobe or superior segment of either lower lobe, with or without cavitation. As disease progresses it spreads to other segments/lobes.Sputum smear: positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Sputum may be spontaneously expectorated or induced, and at least 3 specimens should be collected (minimum 8 hours apart, including an early morning specimen, which is the best way to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Organisms other than M tuberculosis, especially non-tuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., M kansasii and M avium), may be positive for AFB stain.Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) positive for M tuberculosis. DNA or RNA amplification tests for rapid diagnosis. May be used on sputum or any sterile body fluid. Several commercial tests are available. Results available in less than 8 hours in the laboratory. Useful in smear positive disease to confirm that observed mycobacterium are M tuberculosis (95% sensitivity, 99% specificity) and in smear-negative disease for rapid diagnosis (50% sensitivity, 95% specificity). In suspected smear-negative cases, a moderate to high pretest probability should guide the decision to use NAAT.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, rash, eye pain, photophobia, blurred vision, red eye. Pulmonary examination is usually unrevealing. Can affect any organ, so physical findings depend on specific organs affected. Skin lesions including maculopapular eruptions, subcutaneous nodular lesions and red-purple skin lesions.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest: adenopathy often present with sarcoid. Sarcoid nodules have predilection for upper zones, though can be located throughout the lung.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy reveals presence of non-caseating granulomas. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained by bronchoscopy should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause.CT-guided TTNA can provide access to material from some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained by TTNA should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause.Laboratory markers: ACE elevation may be seen in sarcoidosis, but is non-specific and adds very little information.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Infectious granuloma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History may include travel to endemic areas, pet/animal exposures and specific leisure activities (e.g., caving).May feature cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever, joint aches, skin lesions and night sweats. Many possible causes: Histoplasma capsulatum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus, Pseudallescheria boydii, Fusarium spp, zygomycetes, and others.Non-specific skin findings may be seen in atypical mycobacteria and cryptococcosis. Lymphadenopathy with active disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest typically shows lesions &lt;2 cm diameter with round, smooth borders. May have central, laminated or diffuse calcification patterns if lesions are old. Sometimes mediastinal lymphadenopathy with or without lymph node calcifications. Angioinvasive fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Pseudallescheria boydii, Fusarium spp. and zygomycetes) can be seen as nodules with 'halo sign' or ground-glass opacity surrounding a nodule. Occasionally, calcifications can be seen in the spleen or liver.Fungal serologies: positive during active infection. The exact role of fungal serologies in assessing lung nodules is unclear; however, they provide valuable evidence of exposure to histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, and mucormycosis.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy can provide sample for identification and culture and sensitivity of organism.CT-guided TTNA can provide biopsy from some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy. Pneumothorax complicates 20% to 30% of procedures. The choice between bronchoscopy and TTNA is based on lesion size, location, risks and local expertise.PET-FDG scan: usually negative (&lt;2.5 standardised uptake values). May be falsely positive in active infectious processes.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Amyloidosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Weight loss, paraesthesias, dyspnoea and fatigue are the most common symptoms associated with amyloidosis and are common to all systemic forms; weight loss of &gt;9 kg is common. Small vessel involvement can cause jaw claudication, calf and limb claudication and, rarely, angina. Amyloid purpura is present in around 1 in 6 patients, typically periorbital. Eyelid petechiae are common. Hepatomegaly &gt;5 cm below the right costal margin is seen in 10% of patients and splenomegaly is usually of modest degree.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest shows lung involvement characterised by focal pulmonary nodules, tracheobronchial lesions or diffuse alveolar deposits.Serum immunofixation shows presence of monoclonal protein; seen in 60% of patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL).Urine immunofixation shows presence of monoclonal protein; seen in 80% of patients with amyloidosis.Immunoglobulin free light chain assay shows abnormal kappa to lambda ratio.

"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Arthralgias, pain, skin nodules, pleural effusions, pleuritis, joint pain and deformity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest typically shows lung nodule 3 mm to 7 cm, predominantly in peripheral upper and mid-lung zones. May show cavitation.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy shows rheumatoid necrobiotic nodule. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause. Necrobiotic nodules present as a central zone of eosinophilic fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by palisading fibroblasts, the nodule often being centred on necrotic inflamed blood vessels.Laboratory markers: patients with lung nodules due to rheumatoid arthritis frequently have high levels of rheumatoid factor, although seronegative cases have been reported.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest shows solitary or multiple lung nodules. Airways are frequently affected.Flexible bronchoscopy shows presence of necrotising granulomatous inflammation. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained by bronchoscopy or TTNA should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause.CT-guided TTNA can provide access to some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy.Laboratory markers: anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) detected. ANCA testing results depends on the extent and severity of the disease. Generalised Wegener's granulomatosis has &gt;90% C-ANCA or PR-3 positive. Limited Wegener's granulomatosis has 60% ANCA positive.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section14'>Thyroid mass</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms and signs depend on size of mass. May be visible/palpable as lump on anterior aspect of neck. May present with dysphagia, hoarseness, difficulty breathing and pain in neck or throat. May also be signs and symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism depending on the nature of the mass.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laboratory testing should include thyroid function panel, with TSH, free T4, and free T3.I-123 thyroid scan is ordered for patients with overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism. A hyperfunctioning (hot) nodule is almost always benign. Most nodules are hypofunctioning (cold). Most of these are benign, but malignant nodules are also cold.Ultrasound and Doppler can be used to define dimensions of thyroid nodules and solid/cystic component(s). Features suspicious of malignancy include microcalcifications, a more tall-than-wide shape, hypervascularity, marked hypoechogenicity or irregular margins. It can also guide fine needle aspiration, which can reveal malignant cells or cyst fluid.CT neck can evaluate cervical lymph nodes in cases of medullary thyroid cancer and extension of the scan into the chest can help evaluate a retrosternal thyroid mass.</p>",
