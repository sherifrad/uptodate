"<dt><a href='#Section0'>Syphilis (Treponema pallidum)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Syphilis is in the differential with the presentation of a genital ulcer; however, the primary chancre caused by syphilis differs by its indurated margins, and the associated inguinal lymphadenopathy is usually bilateral and non-tender.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A rapid plasma regain or VDRL test with a confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test should always be sent as part of a diagnostic work-up for lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Dark field microscopy from the swab of a primary syphilitic chancre may also reveal treponemes. [12]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Gonococcal proctitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Particularly in women and men who have sex with men (MSM) who report a history of receptive anal intercourse, gonococcus is frequently co-transmitted, and though frequently asymptomatic, the acute presentation is very similar to LGV in early stages of proctitis, but LGV progresses to late stages marked by granulomatous inflammation, strictures, and chronic ulcerations. [22]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis can be made with swab sent for culture, Gram stain, nucleic acid amplification test or DNA probe for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Genital herpes (HSV)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> HSV usually presents as painful vesicles that ulcerate; whereas LGV primary ulcers are painless. Genital herpes is also usually associated with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, as opposed to LGV, which tends to be unilateral.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> HSV can be isolated by swab in tissue culture or identified by PCR. Cytological changes may also be observed on a Tzank smear. [23]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Chancroid</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Chancroid differs from LGV by the predominance of multiple painful papules that rapidly become pustular and exudative.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Gram stain (with Gram-negative rods in a pattern referred to as 'school of fish') and culture for Haemophilus ducreyi are often helpful but the specificity and yield are poor. PCR assays are available. [23]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Granuloma inguinale/donovanosis (Klebsiella granulomatis)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar to LGV, ulcerative lesions are painless, but granuloma inguinale spreads subcutaneously and usually progress without true lymphadenitis. Genital lesions are highly vascular, tend to be very friable, and coalesce.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Definitive diagnosis requires visualisation of dark-staining, Donovan bodies on tissue preparation or biopsy. Routine isolation by culture is difficult. [23]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Filariasis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lymphatic filariasis is in the differential for inguinal lymphadenopathy presenting in endemic regions; however, pruritus and cutaneous manifestations in the extremities suggest parasitic infection rather than LGV.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Micro-filariae that cause lymphatic filariasis can be detected in blood. Nocturnally periodic micro-filariae can be provoked into the blood circulation during the daytime with a dose of diethylcarbamazine if blood testing at night is unfeasible.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Though regional lymphadenopathy is the most characteristic manifestation of cat-scratch disease, most patients will report a history of recent contact with a kitten.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis may be confirmed by PCR from a lymph node, but in combination with clinical findings, serological testing is the initial test of choice. [24]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Tularaemia (Francisella tularensis)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tularaemia is usually transmitted by tick or animal exposure. Depending on the portal of entry, tularaemia may present as an ulceroglandular syndrome, but the primary skin lesion is a papule that necroses and leaves behind a painful ulcer. Regional lymphadenopathy may precede, coincide or follow this. In LGV, lymphadenopathy appears after the primary ulcer, which is painless and recedes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> F tularensis can occasionally be isolated from blood, lymph nodes or wounds, but because of the danger to laboratory personnel and its potential use as an agent of bioterrorism, laboratory personnel should be cautioned if suspected. Rapid diagnostic tests are available by serological and PCR assays. [25]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with an inguinal bubo due to plague will usually be acutely ill. Buboes tend to develop rapidly with exquisite tenderness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Y pestis may be isolated by culture from blood or swabs of skin lesions. Because of the danger to laboratory personnel and its potential use as an agent of bioterrorism, laboratory personnel should be cautioned if suspected. Serological tests are available in patients suspected, but who have negative cultures. [26]</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section9'>TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis or disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> LGV and TB share the propensity for the formation of chronic sinuses, especially in HIV-positive patients, when extra-pulmonary TB may present with genitourinary, GI involvement or as lymphadenitis (scrofula). Usually systemic mycobacterial infections are associated with haematogenous spread and constitutional symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A tuberculin test, or purified protein derivative, is usually positive. Biopsy with acid-fast stains of surgical specimens and/or culture is required for definitive diagnosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Amoebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In MSM presenting with proctocolitis in endemic regions, E histolytica infection may resemble LGV. [27]  Prominent signs and symptoms of invasive disease include diarrhoea, dysentery, and haeme-positive stool.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis of amoebic proctocolitis is made by recovery of parasites in the stool.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Lymphoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lymphoma will usually be associated with constitutional symptoms and generalised lymphadenopathy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis of lymphoma is made by histopathology from a lymph node biopsy.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Incarcerated inguinal hernia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differential for an inguinal mass. Hernia most often can be identified by physical examination and manoeuvres to reduce the hernia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan may be helpful to assess the pelvic anatomy.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Inflammatory bowel disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differential for proctocolitis. LGV is generally confined to the distal sigmoid colon and rectum, whereas Crohn's disease may present anywhere in the GI tract. [16]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histopathology obtained with proctosigmoidoscopy is non-specific and may not help distinguish infection from other inflammatory bowel diseases. [4]  Distinction should be made by performing PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis on rectal swab specimen or biopsy.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section14'>CMV colitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differential for proctocolitis in patients with HIV/AIDS. LGV is generally confined to the distal sigmoid and rectum. [4]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histopathology obtained with proctosigmoidoscopy may help distinguish CMV. PCR from the serum should also detect a high level viraemia.</p>",
