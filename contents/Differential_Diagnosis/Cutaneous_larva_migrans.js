"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum. Usually a history of eating raw or undercooked fish. Presents with a migratory swelling or subcutaneous nodule.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive serological tests.Surgical excision of the lesion may reveal the nematode larvae.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cases reported only in Japan. [29]  Associated with eating raw seafood. Creeping eruption identical to CLM but usually single lesion present on abdomen.",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by cutaneous nodules often with central punctum. Patient frequently aware of movement within nodule. May migrate but typically no thin serpiginous track present. Lesions are not usually located on the feet.",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of exposure to mosquitoes in Central and West Africa. Swelling is subcutaneous. Adult worms may migrate across conjunctivae.",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pruritus typically worse at night. In addition to papules or vesicles, burrows may be evident and will help to make the diagnosis. The wrists, ankles, palms, soles, interdigital spaces, axilla, waist, and groin are the most commonly affected sites. Patients will often report similar symptoms in family members or other close contacts. [30]",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is initially clinical because egg laying has not yet begun; later, microscopy of stool and urine allows quantification of egg burden and Schistosoma species identification, and schistosomiasis serology will reveal antibodies against parasite antigens.</p>",
