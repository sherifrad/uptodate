"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A much rarer condition that presents most frequently in the older adult (&gt;60 years of age).Patients are more likely to have other associated conditions such as autoimmune disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, hepatitis, pregnancy, and malignancy.May present with bleeding into the skin (purpura), soft tissues, and mucous membranes. [32]Musculoskeletal bleeding is less common than with congenital haemophilia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Factor VIII levels are low, with positive factor VIII inhibitor.Unlike congenital haemophilia, the aPTT does not correct by mixing with normal plasma (mixing study). This is due to the presence of inhibitory antibodies.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Family history is usually positive, including both females and males, due to an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.Bleeding symptoms may be similar to mild congenital haemophilia, although patients with von Willebrand disease tend to have more mucosal bleeding symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is based on various tests, including von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, VWF activity (ristocetin cofactor or collagen-binding assay), factor VIII assay, and VWF multimers.Most clinicians agree that VWF levels &lt;30 international units/dL are consistent with a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease. [28]  However, repeated testing is often needed to confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Bleeding pattern is typically mucocutaneous and not musculoskeletal as in haemophilia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Platelet aggregation studies are the diagnostic test of choice to diagnose most platelet disorders. [31]Specific platelet agonists (ADP, adrenaline, collagen, ristocetin, and arachidonic acid) are used to assess platelet aggregation by measuring optical density.Platelet electron microscopy can also be used to evaluate platelet ultrastructure.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Musculoskeletal bleeding is uncommon.Factor V mutations are associated with the occurrence of thrombosis.There have also been cases of thrombosis reported in people with factor VII deficiency.",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC may reveal anaemia, which may be chronic in neglected or malnourished children.Liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated if abdominal trauma.Imaging may reveal abnormal x-rays with evidence of fractures, or abnormal brain or abdominal imaging due to bleeding.</p>",
