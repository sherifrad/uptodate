"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Greater trochanteric bursitis in the hip and pes anserine bursitis in the knee present with pain over the lateral aspect of the hip and over the medial aspect of the knee, respectively. There is also local tenderness in these areas that is usually absent in simple OA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Local anaesthetic and corticosteroid injection might be therapeutic and diagnostic if it relieves symptoms to a significant degree.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The onset of arthritis in gout is usually more acute and over a period of a few hours, but could mimic an exacerbation of acute OA.Gout or pseudogout often co-exists in the same joint. In acute attacks of crystal arthritis, the affected joint is usually red, hot, and acutely tender.Gout commonly involves the foot, especially the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, although it may affect almost any joint.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Arthrocentesis and joint fluid analysis, which shows leukocytes &gt;2000 cells/mm^3, and the presence of sodium monourate crystals.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The onset of arthritis in pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition [CPPD]) is usually more acute and over a period of a few hours, but could mimic an exacerbation of acute OA. Associated with other conditions (e.g., haemochromatosis) and results in secondary pseudo-OA, which often involves the MCP joints.Gout or pseudogout often co-exists in the same joint. In acute attacks of crystal arthritis, the affected joint is usually red, hot, and acutely tender.Pseudogout often involves the wrist and knee, although it may affect almost any joint.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Arthrocentesis and joint fluid analysis, which shows leukocytes &gt;2000 cells/mm^3, and the presence of pyrophosphate crystals.Radiographs: chondrocalcinosis; in cases of haemochromatosis, hook-like osteophytes in the second and third metacarpal heads.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> It is usually straightforward to differentiate RA from OA based on the number and distribution of the involved joints.RA usually causes a symmetrical small joint polyarthritis in the hands, particularly affecting the MCP joints and sparing the DIP joints. Typically, RA is associated with more prolonged morning stiffness than OA. Patients with acute RA may also feel generally unwell, with fatigue and low mood.Differentiation is sometimes challenging for hand involvement, and the two conditions, OA and RA , can co-exist.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In RA, ESR and CRP are abnormal and rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies are positive. Typical RA erosive changes are seen on x-ray, MRI, or ultrasound.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Psoriatic arthritis can occur in the absence of skin psoriasis and often affects the DIP joints.In psoriatic arthritis, the joint involvement is usually asymmetrical, but inflammatory OA can be difficult to distinguish from some cases of psoriatic arthritis with only DIP involvement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In psoriatic arthritis, x-ray shows typical erosive changes.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Avascular necrosis (AVN)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is common in the hip and knee joints. The onset is subacute and there is usually a risk factor such as corticosteroid use. Early on, the joint examination is unremarkable, except for possible localised bony tenderness in the knee.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI is the most sensitive test in AVN. In the early stages, localised subchondral oedema is characteristic. In 50% of all cases, accompanying joint effusion may be found. Due to necrosis of the cells of bone marrow and bone fibrovascular tissue, reactions with hyperaemia can be delineated. [33]</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The onset of meniscal tears is usually acute and debilitating, with preceding trauma, although the trauma can be minor. Patients may describe true locking (normal flexion, but an inability to extend the affected knee).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI is sensitive in detecting both acute meniscal and cruciate ligament tears, although degenerative meniscal tears are common in OA.</p>",
