"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Visual symptoms are more prominent in orbital cellulitis because of the involvement of the optic nerve.May manifest in only one eye, whereas cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) progresses more commonly to both eyes. [43]Less likely to have profound sepsis, meningeal signs and early fixation of the globe compared with CST. [43]  [44]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan and MRI of the head can differentiate between early CST and peri-orbital or orbital cellulitis by the presence of enlargement and expansion of the cavernous sinus in CST. [44]If an LP is performed, 75% of people with septic CST will have inflammatory cells on CSF analysis, unlike people with peri-orbital or orbital cellulitis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents as ocular pain, proptosis, external ophthalmoplegia (owing to the paralysis of cranial nerves (CNs) III, IV, VI) and neuralgic pain/anaesthesia of the involved areas supplied by the first and second branch of the trigeminal nerve. [45]All differentiating features are subtle and relative.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with internal and external ophthalmoplegia, visual loss and trigeminal nerve (CN V1) anaesthesia. Visual impairment present because of optic nerve involvement. This is less likely to be a feature in CST.Trigeminal nerve anaesthesia is also a differentiating sign.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents as the superior orbital syndrome.All differentiating features are subtle and relative.Characteristically, responds well to corticosteroids. [46]",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Location can be either spheno-orbital, superior orbital fissure or cavernous sinus.Presenting signs depend on the site of involvement but, generally, this diagnosis results in focal neurological symptoms.There is generally an absence of sepsis, fever and bi-lateral eye involvement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI of the head demonstrating the meningioma as hyper-intense on T1, mixed intensity on T2 and enhancement with gadolinium with a dural tail sign (extension of a mass toward the dura giving the appearance of a tail).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually a history of trauma, especially basilar skull fractures. [47]  [48]Can also be caused by rupture of an intra-cavernous carotid aneurysm or an atherosclerotic internal carotid artery and there may be a history of these conditions. [49]Can either be direct with shunts between the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid or as dural shunts between the cavernous sinus and the meningeal branches of the internal or external carotid artery. [49]The direct shunt usually causes pulsatile exophthalmos, in addition to the other symptoms of ophthalmoplegia, a reduced visual acuity and venous congestion. [50]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or carotid angiography: these tests will demonstrate blockage of the cavernous sinus in CST compared with abnormal connections between the carotid and cavernous sinus in carotid-cavernous fistula.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan or MRI of the head will show significant invasion of bone and blood vessels.There is characteristic hypo-density on T2-weighted MRI. [52]CT scan or MRI of the head will show involvement of the cavernous sinuses in CST.</p>",
