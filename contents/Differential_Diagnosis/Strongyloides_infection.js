"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No differentiating signs or symptoms.Hookworm has a finite life span of &lt;5 years. Thus, in people residing in a developed country for 5 years or more, strongyloides is the more likely diagnosis as it carries on lifelong auto-infection within the human body without need for re-exposure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In stool specimens having delayed processing time, hookworm ova may hatch with larvae that appear similar to strongyloides larvae. Therefore it is important to determine whether a delay in processing occurred. Repeat testing may be necessary.Hookworm therapy is insufficient to eradicate strongyloides.Eosinophilia, when present, is a marker of treatment failure.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dipstick U/A may be positive for blood in urinary schistosomiasis.Standard stool or urine ova and parasite (O&amp;P) examination will differentiate the conditions, although it is a relatively insensitive test for diagnosis of schistosomiasis.Serological testing is available and may differentiate the conditions.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool O&amp;P examination and serology are negative.The presence of eosinophilia in a high-risk person (such as a person migrating from an endemic area) alerts the physician to look for other causes apart from asthma, especially when the asthma-like symptoms are of new onset in an adult.</p>",
