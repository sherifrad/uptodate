"<dt><a href='#Section0'>Breast engorgement</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Engorgement usually occurs on the third to fifth post-partum day.There may be bilateral generalised breast pain, firmness, erythema, warmth, and a mild fever (milk fever), but there is usually no oedema.Relieved by frequent emptying of the breasts (e.g., breastfeeding).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually becomes clinically apparent as breastfeeding continues.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Nipple sensitivity</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is usually no evidence of nipple trauma, features of breast inflammation, or fever.Nipple vasospasm (Raynaud's phenomenon) may manifest with nipple pain.Nipple sensitivity with breastfeeding usually subsides once suckling begins, whereas pain from trauma or infection persists or increases.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually becomes clinically apparent as breastfeeding continues.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Galactocoele</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A milk retention cyst may cause a tender palpable breast lump, but there are usually no sharp shooting pains and no signs of breast inflammation or systemic illness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A galactocoele appears on ultrasound as a well-defined lesion with a thin echogenic wall, which may contain coarse calcification. A breast abscess may also be well circumscribed, macrolobulated, irregular, or ill defined with possible septae.Galactocele aspiration yields non-purulent milk.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Fibrocystic breasts</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Painful breast tissue before menses improves during menstruation.Lumps are palpated mainly in the upper outer quadrant.A non-bloody nipple discharge may be reported.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound may help to diagnose benign cystic breast tissue.Mammography is only indicated to help with diagnosis of fibrocystic disease in older women, not adolescents, because the density of breast tissue in adolescents makes interpretation difficult.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Mastodynia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mastalgia may be cyclic or non-cyclic with menstruation.There should be no symptoms or signs of breast inflammation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Specific tests are not indicated.Diagnosis is based on history and examination.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Breast trauma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Trauma may cause fat necrosis, which could manifest as a breast mass.Signs of inflammation are uncommon.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging studies may mimic carcinoma (as also occurs on occasion with breast infection).A biopsy may be indicated for a definitive diagnosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Primary invasive breast cancer</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The signs and symptoms of breast cancer may be similar to those of breast infection.It may present as a hard, irregular, painless mass that may or may not be fixed to the underlying tissue.There may be a nipple discharge, nipple or skin retraction, skin oedema (peau d'orange), and regional lymphadenopathy. Paget's disease will involve the nipple.Inflammatory breast cancer may resemble mastitis with breast enlargement, warmth, tenderness, oedema, erythema, and possible skin discoloration.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging studies, such as mammography, may reveal a mass, increased density, and micro-calcification.Percutaneous biopsy (recommended method), or surgical excision (excisional biopsy) if indicated, is necessary to establish the diagnosis.A skin-punch biopsy for inflammatory breast carcinoma will show tumour infiltration of dermal lymphatics.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Fibroadenoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents typically as a non-tender, rubbery, well-circumscribed, and mobile mass.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging studies, such as breast ultrasound and mammography, generally reveal a solid, homogeneous, well-circumscribed, avascular mass with occasional coarse calcification.Pathological examination will demonstrate a fibroepithelial lesion.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Fat necrosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically results in a tender, round, firm breast mass.The skin may be dimpled over such a lump.Inflammation is usually not a common feature unless there is an associated infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Breast imaging findings may not be specific.A breast biopsy is the most accurate means of providing a definitive diagnosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Diabetes</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May manifest with one or more hard, irregular, mobile, discrete, painless, palpable masses.Complications arising from diabetes such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy may be present.Breast lesions tend to be recurrent and bilateral.Patients may have other autoimmune diseases.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Breast imaging studies may be non-specific and can mimic cancer.Biopsy shows sclerosing lobular lymphocytic mastitis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Mondor's disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Thrombophlebitis of a superficial vein may cause breast pain and a cord-like mass with possible skin dimpling, usually in the lower quadrants.The cord is accentuated by traction, elevation of the breast, or abduction of the ipsilateral arm.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Mammography and a microbiology work-up are usually negative.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Systemic lupus erythematosus</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A history of SLE is highly suggestive.There may be a tender mass lesion with possible skin changes.Chronic mastitis with flares may be reported.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serological evidence of lupus is usually present.Mammography may show architectural distortion, fat necrosis, or calcifications. [42]A biopsy may help, showing lupus panniculitis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Necrotising fasciitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may have fever, chills, and extreme pain associated with rapidly advancing skin erythema, and possible cyanosis, vesicles, bullae, ulcers, crepitation, and a black necrotic eschar.Examination by an experienced surgeon is critical.A history of prior trauma, skin biopsy, or a surgical wound in the mammary region may be reported.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laboratory tests may show leukocytosis, elevated urea, and reduced serum sodium level.Infection can be diagnosed with rapid streptococcal diagnostic kits, if available.Microbiology studies and excisional deep skin biopsy may be helpful in diagnosing and identifying the causative organisms and confirming the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Hidradenitis suppurativa</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents mainly around hair follicles in the axilla and intertriginous regions under the breasts.Lesions range from comedones to painful lumps, abscesses, and skin scarring, and these may be associated with a purulent discharge.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A biopsy will show acute and chronic folliculitis with a possible foreign body giant cell inflammation.</p>",

"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is localised sternal pain, often exacerbated with respiration or activity.Pain may radiate.A palpable swelling with redness is often located about 4 cm from the sternal edge.A breast examination is usually unremarkable.",
