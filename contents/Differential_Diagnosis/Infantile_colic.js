"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In the first few months of life the symptoms of UTI are often non-specific and include fever, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, and poor weight gain.Malodorous urine is highly suggestive.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Regurgitation is present at birth and becomes more pronounced in the second or third week of life. The regurgitation is often effortless and is worse after meals when the infant is in a recumbent position, or when pressure is applied to the abdomen.Some infants may present with complications such as failure to thrive, aspiration pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The diagnosis is mainly clinical. When the diagnosis is ambiguous or when complications are suspected, further investigations may be warranted.Barium swallow and fluoroscopy may show the gastro-oesophageal reflux and the presence of peptic oesophagitis.Radionuclide gastro-oesophagography is a non-invasive test to demonstrate gastro-oesophageal reflux. Gastro-oesophageal reflux associated with the appearance of radiotracer in the lung provides evidence that respiratory symptoms are related to the reflux.24-hour intra-oesophageal pH monitoring can be used to diagnose gastro-oesophageal reflux and determine its severity.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain abdominal x-rays may show dilated loop of intestine, air-fluid levels, paucity of air in the right lower quadrant, minimal faecal content, and a soft mass in the right or mid abdomen.Abdominal ultrasonography may show a tubular mass (sandwich or pseudokidney sign) in longitudinal views and a target appearance (doughnut sign) in transverse views.If doubt remains, the diagnosis can be confirmed by x-ray with barium or air insufflation; both procedures are therapeutic as well as diagnostic.</p>",
