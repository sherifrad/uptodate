"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Also occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy or postpartum, and may be difficult to distinguish from HELLP.Patients may have hypertension and/or proteinuria, although not frequently.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Total bilirubin is increased much more than in HELLP syndrome, to levels in excess of 4 mg/dL. The direct fraction of bilirubin is increased (unlike in HELLP syndrome, in which the indirect bilirubin fraction is increased).Coagulopathy ( hypofibrinogenaemia, prolonged PT, low antithrombin) is usually present early in the disease (unlike in HELLP syndrome, in which coagulopathy develops in the late stages).Liver transaminases are generally &lt;500 units/L, although in some severe cases may exceed 1000 units/L.Hypoglycaemia (not typically present in HELLP unless there is liver failure) is a key distinguishing factor, as is leukocytosis (&gt;130 x 10^9/L [&gt;13,000/microL] with left shift). There may also be haemoconcentration, metabolic acidosis, increased ammonia, and elevated serum creatinine (mean 203.3 micromol/L [2.3 mg/dL]) and uric acid (mean 654.3 micromol/L [11 mg/dL]). [23]Liver biopsy is the standard for confirming the diagnosis, but it is rarely used in clinical practice.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can be difficult to distinguish from HELLP.Classic pentad of TTP consists of thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, neurological abnormalities, fever, and renal impairment.However, neurological abnormalities may be non-specific (such as headaches, visual changes, weakness, and seizures) and therefore difficult to diagnose and to distinguish from HELLP syndrome.Presenting features may also include abdominal pain, hypertension, nausea, and vomiting, in conjunction with jaundice, petechiae, purpura, or other abnormal bleeding.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thrombocytopenia is more severe than in HELLP syndrome (&lt;25 x 10^9/L [&lt;25,000/microL]) and often requires transfusion.Liver transaminases increase less than they do in HELLP syndrome, usually there is no coagulopathy, and antithrombin levels are unchanged.Maternal condition does not improve with delivery. [24]ADAMTS13 (a von Willebrand's factor-cleaving metalloprotease) is markedly reduced (to &gt;5% of normal) in most patients with congenital TTP, and antibodies that neutralise ADAMTS13 have been found in women with acquired TTP. However, testing for ADAMTS13 is not readily available in most clinical laboratories. [25]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rarely associated with pregnancy; almost universally occurring in the postpartum period (up to 10 weeks). [26]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presentation is similar to that in TTP, both being characterised by micro-angiopathic haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. In HUS, the microvascular injury mainly affects the kidneys, renal function deterioration being more significant than in TTP and HELLP, and haemolysis may also be prominent, frequently requiring blood transfusions.There are no coagulation abnormalities [26]  [27]  and antithrombin levels are unchanged.Liver transaminases are less elevated than they are in HELLP syndrome.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Severe generalised pruritus, mild jaundice, mild epigastric pain, steatorrhoea, and dark urine are among the most common findings.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Mild elevations of liver transaminases, rarely &gt;250 units/L, but increased alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinaemia (predominantly conjugated) up to 6 times greater than normal, and markedly elevated (10-fold to 100-fold) total serum bile acids. The diagnosis of cholestasis is unlikely if the total bile acids are &lt;8 micromol/L. [28]</p>",
