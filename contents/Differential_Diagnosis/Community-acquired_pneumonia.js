"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of being hospitalised or institutionalised is the differentiating factor; everything else would be similar to CAP.Possibly different pathogens.Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia is caused by aspiration of oral and gastric secretions into the bronchial tree.Aspiration pneumonia is more prevalent in patients who are debilitated. Treatment needs to include antibiotics for Pseudomonas and anaerobic organisms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laboratory tests will identify pathogens.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Testing is not necessary for all patients who present with influenza-like illness.Definitive diagnosis can be made with real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) of respiratory specimens or viral culture using panels that probe for human and swine influenza A.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sudden onset of febrile respiratory illness characterised by upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms of rhinorrhoea, cough, fever, chills, headache, and myalgia.Typically presents in winter season.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The criterion standard for diagnosing influenza A and B is a viral culture of nasopharyngeal samples and/or throat samples; however, most physicians diagnose influenza based on clinical criteria alone.</p>",
