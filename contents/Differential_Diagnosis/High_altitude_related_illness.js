"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Although the absence of common triggers such as house dust mites, pollution, and pollen may improve the symptoms of some sufferers, exercise, low humidity, and cold exposure may exacerbate the condition in others. [52]The presence of wheeze and diurnal variation of symptoms is rare in high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPO).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Therapeutic trial with short acting beta-2-agonists will significantly improve symptoms. [23]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be difficult to clinically differentiate.The presence of green or yellow sputum, rigors, and a high fever that do not resolve on descent are suggestive of pneumonia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated WBC and positive sputum cultures.Chest x-ray may demonstrate infiltration, consolidation, effusions, and cavitation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Acute CHF</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> While significant numbers of individuals with cardiac risk factors head to altitude, the vast majority do not. [53]  It is therefore far more likely that those presenting with peripheral oedema, cyanosis, tachypnoea, cough, and blood-stained sputum are suffering from HAPO and should be treated accordingly.Pronounced right-sided heart failure (ascites, hepatomegaly, and an elevated jugular venous pressure) may help distinguish the condition from HAPO.Presence of a gallop rhythm or a heart murmur (will be absent in HAPO).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cardiomegaly on CXR.ECG may demonstrate arrhythmia, ischaemic ST- and T-wave changes.Echocardiography shows abnormal systolic and diastolic function.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Hyperventilation syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be triggered by the demands of the high-altitude environment; therefore is often difficult to distinguish clinically from HAPO.Those with HAPO predominantly suffer from the effects of hypoxia; those with hyperventilation will be affected by hypocapnia, dizziness, paraesthesia, and perceptual disturbances.Unlike HAPO, hyperventilation responds to breathing into a small air-tight container or encouraging a conscious reduction in rate of breathing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Myocardial infarction</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Unlike the chest pain in HAPO, MI pain is often described as a crushing pain radiating into the neck, jaw, and arms. While this may be eased with oxygen and rest similar to HAPO, descent may have little effect upon such symptoms.The presence of acute mountain sickness symptoms and evidence of cough and abnormalities on chest auscultation makes a diagnosis of HAPO more likely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG demonstrates arrhythmia or acute ischaemic ST- and T-wave changes.Cardiac catheterisation will demonstrate abnormal coronary flow.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In the absence of clinical signs of DVT (pain, swelling, and redness in an affected limb) distinguishing pulmonary embolism (PE) from HAPO is difficult in the field setting.In the absence of any improvement on descent or HAPO treatment, the diagnosis of HAPO will be unlikely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive D-dimer.ECG changes suggestive (but not diagnostic) of PE include tachycardia, new right axis deviation, new right bundle branch block and the classical S wave in lead I, Q wave with T-wave inversion in lead III.Ventilation-perfusion scan demonstrates abnormality in perfusion.CT pulmonary angiography demonstrates the presence of thrombus in the pulmonary vessels.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Acute psychosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Thought disorder, delusions, and sensory hallucinations are features consistent with a diagnosis of acute psychosis.Although high-altitude cerebral oedema (HACO) tends to present with motor symptoms, visual disturbance, and changes in the level of consciousness, in some cases the condition can be confused with psychotic behaviour (personality changes and episodes of bizarre behaviour).Unlike HACO, symptoms may resolve spontaneously at altitude or persist for long periods without any evidence of physical deterioration typically seen in HACO.In acute psychosis treatment with dexamethasone and supplemental oxygen will be ineffective.",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Carbon monoxide poisoning</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Difficult to differentiate clinically.Carbon monoxide poisoning has been found to occur at altitude following prolonged exposure to gas stoves in confined areas such as snow holes or small tents. [54]Typically, individuals present with flu-like symptoms before eventually developing ataxia, confusion, and loss of consciousness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Carboxyhaemoglobin level is elevated.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Dehydration</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Warm temperatures, prolonged periods of exertion, and limited access to clean water make dehydration a common problem at altitude. Like acute mountain sickness, headache, nausea, dizziness, and tiredness may all occur. However, these symptoms tend to respond quickly to 1 to 2 litres of isotonic fluid. In addition, thirst, orthostatic hypotension, reduced urine output, and the presence of dry skin and mucous membranes may all help distinguish dehydration from high-altitude illness.",

"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Known history of insulin-dependent diabetes. Recent infection or change in insulin therapy.The presence of polyuria, thirst, and acetone on the breath supports the diagnosis of DKA. May be precipitated by high altitude. [55]",

"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> While exhaustion may follow a prolonged period of exertion at altitude, difficulties in sleeping, nausea, headache, and dizziness should be absent.Importantly, in exhausted individuals abnormal neurological signs are absent and they should still be able to perform basic tasks such as eating, drinking, and going to the toilet.",

"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Hangover</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Headache, nausea, and malaise of a hangover can mirror the symptoms of acute mountain sickness.A history of excess alcohol use, an absence of sleep disturbance, and improvement with fluids and simple analgesics supports hangover as a cause of symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Hypoglycaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Neurological changes seen following prolonged periods of hypoglycaemia are easily confused with illness at high altitude.In the absence of blood glucose measurement, a history of palpitations, shakiness, and cold extremities may be associated with the early manifestations of a hypoglycaemic attack.Clinical improvement following the administration of sugary foods makes acute mountain sickness unlikely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Low glucose level.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Hyponatraemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms are similar to acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral oedema; however, cramps and a raised body temperature (&gt;39&deg;C, 102.2&deg;F) may distinguish these from heat exhaustion and salt depletion. [56]  [57]Those with heat exhaustion respond to salt replacement and appropriate fluid resuscitation.In cases of hyponatraemia caused by the intake of excessive amounts of water, fluid restriction is necessary.",

"<dt><a href='#Section14'>Hypothermia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Difficult to differentiate clinically.Core temperature low.Warming measures (hot water bottles, additional layers of dry clothing, and the consumption of warm drinks and food) will correct symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section15'>Ingestion of hallucinogenic agents</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A wide range of hallucinogenic agents are now available in popular high-altitude destinations.While psychiatric symptoms predominate, changes in neurology can make it difficult to distinguish their use from HACO.Supplemental oxygen and other HACO treatments will have no effect.A thorough history from teammates and onlookers is essential.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section16'>Migraine</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section16'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Ascent to high altitude is a recognised trigger for migraine.The presence of a prodrome and aura may help distinguish migraine from acute mountain sickness (AMS). Similarly, migraine headaches tend to be unilateral and pulsating and unlike AMS can be accompanied by nasal stuffiness, scalp tenderness, and changes in bowel and bladder habits.While migraines typically last for up to 72 hours, AMS symptoms may persist for longer and sometimes only resolve with descent.Unlike some migraines, AMS is not associated with menstruation and does not cause visual disturbances or unilateral motor weakness.",

"<dt><a href='#Section17'>Generalised seizures</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section17'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In high-altitude cerebral oedema, seizures tend to occur in the final stages of the condition and will have been preceded by other symptoms.At altitude, seizure activity in those with epilepsy varies between individuals. The combination of poor sleep, hypoxia, and hypocapnia has been postulated as a cause for increasing activity in some cases. [58]A thorough history is useful in these cases and may identify changes in the patient's medicine compliance; or, in those presenting with unexpected seizures, there may be evidence of unexplained events several years before. [58]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI and EEG are confirmatory and will demonstrate epileptiform activity, and focal or localising abnormality.</p>",
