"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A change in the severity of pain, fear of food (due to pain), weight loss, and jaundice may occur.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may detect a pancreatic mass or duct stricture. [106]Other differentiating tests include biopsy and elevated blood tumour markers (CA19-9, CEA).Exclusion of malignancy frequently requires surgical resection to ensure a reliable histopathological examination.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Acute pancreatitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms of mild acute pancreatitis are similar to chronic pancreatitis.Distinguishing features of severe acute pancreatitis include evidence of persistent organ failure (respiratory insufficiency, renal insufficiency, hypotension, and altered mentation).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Three-fold or more elevation in serum amylase and/or lipase.Abdominal CT shows interstitial or necrotising pancreatitis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Biliary colic</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, which is exacerbated by eating fatty foods.The duration of pain is shorter (1 to 2 hours) than in chronic pancreatitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abdominal ultrasound may show cholelithiasis, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by cholescintigraphy.Elevated liver enzymes and common bile duct dilation occur with choledocholithiasis and biliary strictures.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Peptic ulcer disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Distinguishing features include upper abdominal discomfort, nausea, belching, bloating, iron-deficiency anaemia, and possibly melaena and haematemesis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> OGD or upper GI series will demonstrate ulceration.Empirical trial of appropriate management, such as proton-pump inhibitor, resulting in symptomatic improvement would help to differentiate from chronic pancreatitis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Mesenteric ischaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Peri-umbilical, post-prandial abdominal pain, fear of food (due to pain), and weight loss with a soft abdomen suggest chronic mesenteric insufficiency.Acute mesenteric ischaemia typically presents with acute onset of severe peri-umbilical pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Acute and chronic mesenteric insufficiency can be diagnosed by clinical suspicion and angiography. Diagnosis requires clinical suspicion because serum elevation in lipase and amylase can occur in this setting and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of pancreatitis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Aneurysm, abdominal aorta</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually asymptomatic until rupture or dissection, when the patient will present with abdominal or back pain, a pulsatile abdominal mass, and hypotension.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Typically diagnosed incidentally with abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>MI</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Inferior wall MI may present with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and dyspnoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosed by ECG, cardiac enzymes.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Intestinal obstruction</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical symptoms include a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosed by abdominal x-rays and/or CT imaging studies. Diagnosis requires clinical suspicion because serum elevation in lipase and amylase can occur in this setting and lead possibly to an erroneous diagnosis of pancreatitis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Irritable bowel syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common condition that presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habit.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Gastroparesis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A motility disorder characterised by nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and weight loss. Common aetiologies include diabetes mellitus, post-viral, scleroderma, and medicines (e.g., opiates).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosed by gastric emptying study with or without manometry.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Somatisation disorders</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occur in patients with neuropsychiatric disease who describe pain and GI, sexual, and neurological symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Radiculopathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is constant and/or precipitated by positional changes, such as torsion of spine and leg lifts, and may be reproducible with palpation of chest wall and spine.Unilateral abdominal pain localises to a dermatome distribution, possibly wrapping around or radiating to the back.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosed using spine imaging studies and EMG.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Post-herpetic neuralgia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain may be persistent after the disappearance of shingles. Typically a burning pain with altered sensation.Examination may show evidence of skin erythema or vesicles localising to a dermatome.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Abdominal wall pain</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Consider focal abdominal wall nerve impingement if there are scars, abdominal wall hernia, or abdominal wall haematoma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Investigate with abdominal wall ultrasound or CT to exclude abdominal wall hernia and rectus sheath haematoma. Nerve impingement responds typically to trigger point injection.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section14'>Nephrolithiasis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with unilateral pain localising or radiating to a linear distribution from the groin/testicle to the abdomen and back.Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dysuria, urinary urgency, and haematuria.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Non-contrast helical CT scan detects renal collecting system opacities.Additional imaging methods include ultrasonography, abdominal x-ray, and intravenous pyelogram.Urinalysis detects microscopic haematuria.</p>",
