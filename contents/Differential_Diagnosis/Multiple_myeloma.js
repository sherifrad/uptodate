"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Asymptomatic condition. No end-organ damage (bone lesions, anaemia, hypercalcaemia, renal dysfunction). [14]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone marrow biopsy shows &lt;10% of monoclonal plasma cells. The monoclonal component on serum electrophoresis &lt;3 g/dL, no proteinuria. [30]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Localised bone pain or soft tissue swelling.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presence of monoclonal plasmacytosis on biopsy of the lesion (bone or soft tissue), without evidence of plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy. No other osteolytic lesions on skeletal survey, except the diagnostic lesion.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No bone pain. Frequently presents with symptoms of hyperviscosity, such as mucosal bleeding and neurological, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Also presents with organomegaly and lymphadenopathy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum electrophoresis shows IgM &gt;30000 mg/L (3 g/dL). Presence of lymphocytes or plasmacytoid lymphocytes on bone marrow biopsy and skeletal survey is negative. Patients may have evidence of increased serum viscosity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fatigue and weight loss are common symptoms. Hepatomegaly and macroglossia occur in more than 30% of patients, and renal insufficiency occurs in 50% of patients. Possible nephrotic syndrome, congestive heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, carpal tunnel syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy are some other presenting features.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most common presenting symptoms are weakness, fatigue, and fever, associated with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Characterised by the presence of a portion of the Ig heavy chain in the serum or urine or both. Also associated with the presence of lymphoplasmacytic marrow infiltrate.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presenting symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Presenting signs are spleen and lymph node enlargement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lymph node biopsy is diagnostic. Lymphocytic infiltrate may occur in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood flow cytometry may be suggestive of clonal lymphocytosis.</p>",
