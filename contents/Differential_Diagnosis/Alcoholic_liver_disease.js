"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often asymptomatic.History may reveal high-risk behaviour (e.g., illicit intravenous drug use, multiple sexual parters) and absence of chronic heavy alcohol use.May present as acute hepatitis B infection in adults and sometimes can be fatal from complications such as acute liver failure.Patients with chronic hepatitis B may develop complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or liver failure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B virus DNA, or anti-hepatitis B core antigen-IgM antibody.In patients with co-existing ALD and HBV but without cirrhosis, ALT is usually higher than AST.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History may reveal high-risk behaviour (e.g., illicit injection drug use) and absence of chronic heavy alcohol use.Most patients are asymptomatic.In advanced disease, patients exhibit signs and symptoms related to chronic liver injury from hepatitis C such as jaundice, ascites, spider angiomata, and constitutional complaints.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum test positive for anti-hepatitis C virus antibody and hepatitis C virus RNA PCR.Most patients have fluctuating elevation of ALT and AST.In patients with co-existing ALD and HCV but without cirrhosis, ALT is usually higher than AST.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History suggestive of exposure (e.g.,use of contaminated food/water, travel to endemic area, homosexual activity) and absence of binge alcohol use.Symptomatic patients may present with abrupt-onset fever, abdominal pain, malaise, and jaundice. Common examination findings are hepatomegaly and clinical jaundice.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute RUQ abdominal pain, with positive Murphy's sign (pain with inspiration beneath palpation at costal margin).",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Variable chronicity of presentation but classic triad of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and ascites is seen.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound of liver with Doppler study can show obstruction, thrombosis, collaterals, and hyperechoic cords replacing normal venous architecture.CT abdomen with contrast might be more precise for this diagnosis.</p>",
