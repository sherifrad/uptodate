"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most signs and symptoms are similar to SCLC. Typical features include cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnoea, and hoarseness (if recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis). Frequently unwell-looking, short of breath, with signs of recent weight loss.Finger clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may be present and are more common in non-small cell lung cancer compared with SCLC.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest shows size, location, and extent of primary tumour; evaluates for hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and distant metastases.Sputum cytology shows characteristic malignant cells. Specificity greater than 95%, sensitivity variable between 20% to 70%. More likely to be positive with central lesions compared with peripheral lesions.Flexible bronchoscopy plus biopsy provides pathological confirmation of diagnosis. Endobronchial masses can be biopsied with forceps. Endobronchial brushings, washings, and alveolar lavage increase the diagnostic yield. Transbronchial needle aspiration biopsy of accessible parenchymal lesions and mediastinal lymph nodes is now possible. Detection of small peripheral lesions (&lt;2 cm) is improved by use of endobronchial ultrasound.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs and symptoms depend on the location of the primary tumour and distant disease and may include pain, weight loss, malaise, cough, dyspnoea, clubbing, or focal wheezing. Physical findings may be present depending on the location and extent of the disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest shows one or multiple nodules of variable sizes from diffuse micronodular opacities (miliary) to well-defined masses. Lesions are often irregular and in the periphery of the lower lung zones.Sputum cytology may reveal characteristic malignant cells. Yield is higher with large endobronchial lesions or large masses.CT/MRI head, CT abdomen and pelvis: extrapulmonary cancers that commonly metastasise to the lung include melanoma; thyroid carcinoma; oesophageal cancer; ovarian cancer; sarcomas; and adenocarcinomas of the colon, breast, kidney, and testis.PET-FDG scan shows increased uptake in both primary and distant sites. Certain metastatic lesions, such as renal cell carcinoma, have a lower probability of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake.Biopsy during flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy may show characteristic malignant cells. Bronchoscopy has a 100% yield for endobronchial lesions.CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) can reveal characteristic malignant cells in some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy. Pneumothorax complicates 20% to 30% of TTNA procedures. The choice between bronchoscopy and TTNA is based on lesion size, location, risks, and local expertise.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History may include travel to endemic areas, pet/animal exposures, and specific leisure activities (e.g., caving).May feature cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever, joint aches, skin lesions, and night sweats. Many possible causes: Histoplasma capsulatum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus, Pseudallescheria boydii, Fusarium species, zygomycetes, and others.Non-specific skin findings may be seen in atypical mycobacteria and cryptococcosis. Lymphadenopathy may be present with active disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest typically shows lesions &lt;2 cm diameter and round with smooth borders. Old granulomatous disease may feature central, laminated, or diffuse calcification patterns. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy without calcifications is sometimes present. Nodules from angioinvasive fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Pseudallescheria boydii, Fusarium species, and zygomycetes) may demonstrate the 'halo sign' (ground-glass opacity surrounding the nodule). Occasionally, calcifications can be seen in the spleen or liver.Fungal serologies: positive during active infection. The exact role of fungal serologies in assessing lung nodules is unclear. However, they provide valuable evidence of exposure to histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, and mucormycosis.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy can provide sample for identification and culture and sensitivity of organism.CT-guided TTNA can allow biopsy of some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy. Pneumothorax complicates 20% to 30% of TTNA procedures. The choice between bronchoscopy and TTNA is based on lesion size, location, risks, and local expertise.PET: usually negative (&lt;2.5 standardised uptake values). May be falsely positive in active infectious processes.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, rash, eye pain, photophobia, blurred vision, and red eye. Pulmonary examination is usually unrevealing. Can affect any organ, so physical findings depend on specific organs affected. Skin lesions including maculopapular eruptions, subcutaneous nodular lesions, and red-purple skin lesions.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest: adenopathy often present with sarcoid. Sarcoid nodules have predilection for upper zones, although can be located throughout the lung.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy reveals presence of non-caseating granulomas. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained by bronchoscopy should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause.CT-guided TTNA can provide access to material from some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopy. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained by TTNA should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause.Laboratory markers: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) elevation may be seen in sarcoidosis, but is non-specific and adds very little information.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Arthralgias, pain, skin nodules, pleural effusions, pleuritis, joint pain, and deformity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest typically shows lung nodule 3 mm to 7 cm, predominantly in peripheral upper and mid-lung zones. May show cavitation.Flexible bronchoscopy and biopsy shows rheumatoid necrobiotic nodule. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause. Necrobiotic nodules demonstrate a central zone of eosinophilic fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by palisading fibroblasts, the nodule often centred on necrotic inflamed blood vessels.Laboratory markers: patients with lung nodules due to rheumatoid arthritis frequently have high levels of rheumatoid factor, although seronegative cases have been reported.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest shows solitary or multiple lung nodules. Airways are frequently affected.Flexible bronchoscopy shows necrotising granulomatous inflammation. The identification of granulomas on tissue obtained by bronchoscopy or TTNA should be performed by a pathologist and stained for infectious agents before assuming a non-infectious cause.CT-guided TTNA can provide access to some lesions inaccessible to flexible bronchoscopyLaboratory markers: anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). ANCA testing results depend on the extent and severity of the disease. Generalised Wegener's granulomatosis demonstrates &gt;90% C-ANCA or PR-3 positivity. Limited Wegener's granulomatosis demonstrates 60% ANCA positivity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Normally presents as a flu-like illness followed by a second illness lasting 1 to 4 months, with low-grade fever, non-productive cough, malaise, dyspnoea, and weight loss. Sometimes features pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis.In most patients, auscultation reveals fine, dry lung crepitations. Finger clubbing is unusual.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest is preferable to plain chest x-ray as it gives a better assessment of the disease pattern and distribution, and potential sites for biopsy. Typical features include: patchy 'ground-glass' opacities in a sub-pleural and/or peribronchovascular distribution; thickening of bronchial walls and cylindrical dilatation; 3 to 5 mm diameter centrilobular nodules or other ill-defined nodules; mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions.Pulmonary function tests typically show a restrictive pattern.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) shows a mixed cell pattern, with an increase in lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, foamy macrophages, and occasional plasma cells. CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio is decreased. Also, the ratio of lymphocytes to CD8+ cells is significantly increased.Transbronchial lung biopsy, in combination with BAL, can be a useful approach, prior to possible open biopsy.Open lung biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough longer than 2 to 3 weeks, discoloured or bloody sputum, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, pleuritic chest pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest x-ray: primary disease commonly presents as middle and lower lung zone infiltrates. Ipsilateral adenopathy, atelectasis from airway compression and pleural effusion can be seen. Reactivation-type (post-primary) pulmonary TB usually involves apical and/or posterior segment of right upper lobe, apicoposterior segment of left upper lobe or superior segment of either lower lobe, with or without cavitation. As disease progresses it spreads to other segments/lobes.Sputum smear: positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Sputum may be spontaneously expectorated or induced, and at least 3 specimens should be collected (minimum 8 hours apart, including an early morning specimen, which is the best way to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Organisms other than M tuberculosis), especially non-tuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., M kansasii and M avium), may be positive for AFB stain.Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) positive for M tuberculosis. DNA or RNA amplification tests for rapid diagnosis. May be used on sputum or any sterile body fluid. Several commercial tests are available. Results available in less than 8 hours in the laboratory. Useful in smear-positive disease to confirm that observed mycobacterium are M tuberculosis (95% sensitivity, 99% specificity) and in smear-negative disease for rapid diagnosis (50% sensitivity, 95% specificity). In suspected smear-negative cases, a moderate to high pretest probability should guide the decision to use NAAT.</p>",
