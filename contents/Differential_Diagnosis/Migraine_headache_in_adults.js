"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Frequently co-exists with migraine in the same patient. [72]Tension-type headache is an uncommon reason for patients to seek medical care, unless it is very frequent.More than 90% of patients diagnosed in primary care with tension-type headache in fact have migraine, [73]  and 75% of migraineurs have neck pain with attacks.Attacks are generalised throughout the head; often bilateral pressure-like and non-throbbing pain. Often described as feeling like a tight band around the head.No more than one of photophobia, phonophobia, or mild nausea may be seen. Moderate or severe nausea or vomiting excludes the diagnosis.The distinction is best made by taking a careful history and having the patient keep a diagnostic headache diary. [74]",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cluster headache is more common in men. [75]Attacks last less than 3 hours, and cause restlessness and agitation with autonomic signs or symptoms on the side of the pain. [1]Attacks may occur at exactly the same time of the day or night (so-called 'alarm clock' headaches), especially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. [76]By contrast, migraine is more common in women. [75]The distinction is best made by taking a careful history and having the patient keep a diagnostic headache diary. [77]  [78]  [79]",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This headache has a mixed picture of both migraine and tension-type features.Can be globalised and associated with nausea. Requires analgesia at least 2 or 3 days each week, with intake of the drug on at least 10 days per month for at least 3 months.Because they are available without a prescription, over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin, especially aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combinations, are common causes of medication-overuse headache.",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Post-traumatic headaches have no defined features and can mimic most forms of primary headache, including migraine.In a patient with a prior history of migraine, worsening of headache in response to head trauma is considered to be an aggravation of migraine.Diagnosis is made on the basis of the history. Post-traumatic headache is diagnosed only when a new type of headache begins for the first time within 7 days of head or neck injury. [1]",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> SAH is commonly a severe, sudden-onset headache (often called a 'thunderclap' headache), although up to 50% of patients may have a prodrome of a lower-grade 'sentinel' headache. [80]As with migraine, analgesics or triptans may improve the pain. [81]The physical examination may be normal, although up to 25% of patients have neurological findings. [80]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain CT scans can detect the presence of gross blood, but if CT is negative, consider LP in patients with a history strongly suggestive of SAH. Angiography may be needed. [80]</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> While headache is a common symptom in patients with cerebral neoplasms, it has no consistent characteristics and rarely occurs in the absence of other suspicious historical or examination features.Suspicion is increased in patients with a progressive pattern of headache worsening in conjunction with the development of new neurological signs or symptoms.Papilloedema on fundoscopic examination should prompt consideration of a neoplastic or other cause of high CSF pressure.

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Low CSF pressure headache is often worsened with standing and improved with lying down. [83]It can result from a spontaneous or iatrogenic dural tear: for example, following craniotomy or epidural analgesia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The diagnosis of low-pressure headache can be very difficult if the dural tear occurred spontaneously. LP may show a low opening pressure, and MRI scans of the brain with gadolinium may demonstrate pachymeningeal enhancement. [69]  [70]  [71]  Spinal myelogram with CT imaging may demonstrate contrast extravasation. [84]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Historical and physical examination features suggestive of high-pressure headaches include visual disturbances and tinnitus.High CSF pressure can result from intracranial pathology, such as cerebral neoplasms, or from idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).IIH is most common in obese women of childbearing age and is also associated with the use of certain antibiotics and oral contraceptives.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Headache is a common feature of both systemic nervous system and CNS infections, and has no consistent clinical characteristics.The diagnosis is straightforward in the presence of a high fever or altered consciousness. Indolent CNS infections, however, can be more difficult to diagnose.Suspicion for these disorders should be increased in patients with systemic disorders (especially immune compromise) that predispose to infection with Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus, or cytomegalovirus.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Temporal arteritis should be considered in patients over the age of 50 years with new-onset or worsening headache.It is most common in people of northern European descent. [90]If untreated, permanent visual loss can occur.The headache has no characteristic features, but it commonly improves or disappears within 3 days of beginning high-dose corticosteroid treatment. [1]Historical features include a history of jaw claudication, muscle pain, and a tender temporal artery. [90]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ESR is raised in more than 90% of patients, to a median value of 65 mm/hour; biopsy of temporal artery shows typical inflammatory infiltrate. [68]</p>",

[93]In 90% of patients, CVT is associated with focal neurological signs and evidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. [93]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Headache can be a symptom of ischaemic stroke. Migraine, particularly with aura, is an independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke, with highest risk in women aged under 45 years. [94]  [95]Neurological deficit in stroke or TIA is usually maximal at onset and lasts longer than an hour. [96]Migraine aura can be confused with ischaemic stroke or TIA, but typically develops gradually, consists of positive and negative symptoms with no relevant imaging abnormalities, and is fully reversible.
