"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There is no specific diagnostic test for IBS.Patients who fulfil the clinical criteria for IBS and have no alarm features have a very low probability of organic disease. Colonoscopy or colonic imaging is recommended for patients older than 50 years of age due to higher pre-test probability of colorectal cancer. [65]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Average age of onset of inflammatory bowel disease (20 to 40 years) is younger than with colorectal cancer. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease frequently have watery diarrhoea.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum is the definitive test to diagnose Crohn's disease and will show mucosal inflammation and discrete deep superficial ulcers located transversely and longitudinally, creating a cobblestone appearance.
