"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Seen after radiation therapy or after cardiac surgery or recurrent pericarditis.Constrictive pericarditis behaves as if there were a box around the heart. Patients have Kussmaul's sign: an increase in jugular venous pressure with inspiration. This is typically absent in tamponade.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echocardiogram typically can distinguish between these two as constrictive pericarditis typically has no effusion and a thickened pericardium. Early diastolic filling is rapid, with impaired late diastolic filling in constriction. In tamponade, both early and late filling are impaired.CT or MRI may be used to assess the pericardial thickness.Invasive haemodynamic measurements show a steep y-descent before chamber equalisation that is absent in tamponade, creating a 'dip and platea' or 'square root sign'.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Kussmaul's sign.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Differentiated again from tamponade by absence of effusion. Restriction is also marked by LVH, pulmonary HTN, and lack of respiratory reciprocal variation. [25]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs and symptoms similar to advanced tamponade.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echocardiogram is useful. Expect poor ventricular function or regions of abnormal wall motion. Effusion is rare. No evidence of chamber collapse or reciprocal variation.</p>",
