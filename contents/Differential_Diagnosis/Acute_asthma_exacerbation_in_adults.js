"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May cause a localised wheeze, depending on site of obstruction.History may reveal a foreign body aspiration.No significant improvement with bronchodilators.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If the foreign body is radio-opaque, it may appear on a plain x-ray. Otherwise, a CT scan of the chest may suggest an endoluminal obstruction.Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is the definitive test for diagnosis and treatment of a foreign body in the airway.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Vocal cord dysfunction</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Difficult to diagnose.May occur independently from or concomitantly with asthma.More common in young females.Wheezing is often more prominent over the neck.Symptoms may be precipitated by stress and patients may feel worse with bronchodilators as they could heighten anxiety.Frequently inspiratory wheezing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A video laryngostroboscopic examination may show paradoxical vocal cord movement.The classically observed pattern consists of adduction of the anterior two-thirds of the vocal cords with a posterior diamond-shaped chink. This occurs during inspiration but can be present during the entire respiratory cycle and can also be observed on the flow-volume loop as flattening of the inspiratory limb.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of left ventricular dysfunction with signs and symptoms of heart failure including crackles and rales on auscultation of the lungs and peripheral oedema.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presence of pulmonary oedema on chest radiographs should guide the clinician to a cardiac cause of symptoms.Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) may help to exclude cardiac cause if &lt;100 nanograms/L (100 picograms/mL). [28]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Anaphylaxis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More stridor than wheezing.A history of an environmental exposure to a possible stimulus for anaphylaxis is essential.",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Emphysema/COPD</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of smoking that usually exceeds 20 pack-years.COPD exacerbations and asthma exacerbations are clinically similar, with cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing the typical symptoms.Patients with asthma are more likely to have episodic chest symptoms, night-time chest symptoms, and chest symptoms after exposure to allergic triggers.Patients with COPD are more likely to have a daily morning cough that produces mucus, and persistent chest symptoms throughout the day.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients with asthma will present with evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity and reversibility on pulmonary function tests more frequently than patients with COPD.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Carcinoid syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have associated flushing, diarrhoea, or right-sided heart failure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients have significantly raised serum levels of serotonin or its metabolites, of which the most important is 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Wheezing is unusual with pulmonary emboli but may occur with several small emboli.Chest pain would be a differentiating feature.History of risk factors for PE, including immobilisation, previous DVT/PE, or cancer, in a patient with a sudden onset of dyspnoea should prompt additional testing for PE.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A low- or intermediate-probability Well's score along with a negative D-dimer assay may rule out this diagnosis.If clinical suspicion warrants, a CT pulmonary angiogram study or V/Q scan can be performed. [29]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in 1% to 2% of asthma patients.ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis that may cause bronchial obstruction, mucus production, and wheezing.Differential symptoms include fever, haemoptysis, and expectoration of brown mucus plugs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chest radiograph may show pulmonary infiltrates or evidence of bronchiectasis.Skin test reactivity or serum antibodies to Aspergillus are present.Serum IgE is typically &gt;1000 nanograms/mL and there is generally a peripheral blood eosinophilia of &gt;500/mm^3.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can present with symptoms similar to an asthma exacerbation.Shortness of breath and chest tightness are common symptoms of pneumothoraces.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If clinical suspicion warrants, a chest radiograph can be performed to assess for a pneumothorax.</p>",
