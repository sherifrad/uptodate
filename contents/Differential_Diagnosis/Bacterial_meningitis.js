"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Relevant exposure history.No differentiating symptoms and signs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF pressure is usually normal.CSF WBC count may be normal or 0.01 to 0.5 x 10^9/L (10 to 500/microlitre) and has a lymphocytic differentiation.CSF glucose is normal and CSF protein slightly elevated.Bacterial culture of CSF is negative.PCR for enteroviruses and herpes viruses.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No differentiating symptoms and signs.History of culprit drug use (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, ranitidine).",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of contact or resident in endemic area.Symptoms and signs of pulmonary and extra-neural disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF smear and culture: sensitivity of smear &gt;50% if repeated drops of CSF sediment dried on a slide and then stained and examined at length. Culture requires large volume for maximum sensitivity.Skin testing or interferon-gamma-based blood tests for exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis supportive, but negative results do not exclude diagnosis of tuberculosis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presentation is often insidious with onset of headache and fever over weeks or months. A rash resembling molluscum contagiosum may be present in disseminated cryptococcal disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Testing CSF for cryptococcal antigen has a sensitivity of almost 100% for cryptococcal meningitis.In HIV-positive patients the fungal burden is high, leading to high CSF pressures. CSF leukocyte count may be low. India ink stain or cryptococcal antigen is usually positive.HIV-negative patients have higher CSF leukocyte counts and India ink stain is positive in only half of cases.</p>",
