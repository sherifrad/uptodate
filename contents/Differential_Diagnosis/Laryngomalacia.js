"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar, although this is often present from birth. Patients have significant feeding problems (choking episodes and recurrent aspiration) and an abnormal or absent cry.Patients may have a hx of birth trauma, Arnold-Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus, or potential for iatrogenic injury, such as recent cardiac surgery.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar, although stridor may be biphasic rather than inspiratory. Feeding difficulties are usually less severe than in laryngomalacia.Patients may have hx of previous intubation if stenosis is acquired.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lateral neck radiograph or CXR may demonstrate subglottic narrowing.Flexible laryngoscopy is usually inadequate for diagnosis.Rigid laryngobronchoscopy reveals stenosis and allows formal sizing (based on endotracheal tube sizes). [26] View image</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar; 50% of children with a subglottic haemangioma have a concurrent cutaneous lesion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Rigid bronchoscopy allows direct visualisation of the vascular lesion. These lesions typically involve the posterolateral aspect of the subglottis; may be unilateral, bilateral, or circumferential.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical presentation may be similar but typically is present from birth.May be exacerbated by supine posture and in the case of vallecular cysts, may be improved with chin lift/jaw thrust. With vallecular cysts, the cry is usually unaffected but may be abnormal with laryngeal cysts.Large vallecular cysts may sometimes be seen with direct examination of the oropharynx.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A lateral x-ray may show a soft tissue density suggesting the presence of a cyst.Endoscopic examination of the larynx reveals these cysts. View image</p>",
