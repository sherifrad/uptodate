"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> While the forefoot is adducted, the heel is neutral or slight valgus without equinus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually not needed, but if underlying anomalies are suspected or when assessing an older child, x-rays can be obtained. These demonstrate a normal hindfoot and medial deviation of the metatarsals at the tarsometatarsal joint.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Forefoot adduction with the hindfoot in valgus. No equinus deformity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Standing x-rays demonstrate an increased angle formed by lines drawn through the calcaneus and talus on anteroposterior views. The navicular is displaced laterally instead of medially on clubfoot x-rays.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The foot is in maximum dorsiflexion at birth (the foot is in contact with the anterior tibia.) The heel is valgus. The deformity can usually be brought to a neutral position.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The foot has the classic appearance of a 'Persian slipper' or rocker-bottom deformity. The heel cord is in fixed equinus as in clubfoot, but the heel in vertical talus is in valgus with the forefoot dorsiflexed at the midtarsal joints.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays to include a maximum plantar flexion lateral view demonstrate a vertically oriented talus with no reduction of the dorsally dislocated forefoot on the talus during plantar flexion.</p>",
