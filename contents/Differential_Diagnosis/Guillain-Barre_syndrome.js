"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Spinal cord disorders including transverse myelitis present with asymmetrical motor or sensory loss usually involving lower extremities, early bowel or bladder dysfunction with persistent incontinence, and segmental radicular pain.Physical examination demonstrates upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, positive Babinski response) and a sensory level.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF analysis: pleocytosis with modest number of lymphocytes and increase in total protein.MRI shows focal demyelination with possible enhancement at the appropriate level. [54]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Myasthenia gravis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Early involvement of muscle groups including extra-ocular, levator, pharyngeal jaw, neck, and respiratory muscles. Sometimes presents without limb weakness.Excessive fatigability and variation of symptoms and signs through the day is common.Reflexes are preserved, and sensory features, dysautonomia, and bladder dysfunction are absent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrophysiological study shows normal nerve conduction and presence of decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation.EMG shows abnormal jitter and blocking.Edrophonium test is normally positive. [110]  However, many centres do not routinely perform this test because of potential side effects.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can be difficult to differentiate because of similar clinical characteristics. However, some characteristics are more typical for LEMS. These include slower development of clinical symptoms, dry mouth, lack of objective sensory loss, rare involvement of respiratory muscle group, and potentiation of reflexes after exercise or contraction. [110]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrophysiological study: hallmark is a low amplitude compound muscle action potential (CMAP) after single nerve stimulus, increase in CMAP amplitude after voluntary contraction, or repetitive stimulation at high frequencies. [110]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Botulism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of ingesting food tainted with botulinum toxin.Descending paralysis begins in the bulbar muscles then the limbs, face, neck, and respiratory muscles.Respiratory muscles are involved with mild limb weakness, and reflexes are usually preserved.Ptosis, dilated non-reactive pupils are present. Dilated non-reactive pupils are uncommon in GBS, but it is more common in botulism.Constipation is also a characteristic feature of botulism. [110]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrophysiological study: reduced amplitude of evoked muscle potentials, increase in amplitude with repetitive nerve stimulation, and increased number of myopathic units, which is atypical for GBS. [110]</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presence of pain and muscle tenderness usually in the shoulder and upper arms, involvement of flexor neck muscle disproportionate to limb weakness, absence of sensory symptoms, preservation of reflexes, absence of dysautonomia, and presence of skin lesions, which are uncommon presentation for GBS. [110]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated ESR and CK, normal nerve conduction study, and myopathic changes with fibrillation on EMG.Muscle biopsy shows muscle fibre destruction and regeneration, and lymphocyte infiltrates. [110]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common features include painful asymmetrical presentation of muscle weakness, uncommon involvement of cranial nerves, respiratory paralysis, and sphincter dysfunction.Usually patients complain of fever, fatigue, weakness, and arthralgia. [110]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> May have elevated ESR.CSF does not show albuminocytological dissociation.Electrophysiological study shows evidence of denervation.Nerve biopsy shows signs of inflammation and scarring. [110]</p>",
