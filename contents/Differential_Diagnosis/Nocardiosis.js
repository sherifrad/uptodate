"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical differentiation is difficult. In immunocompetent patients, cavities are more frequently related to tuberculosis. In immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS, cavities are less frequently associated with tuberculosis and very common in nocardiosis. [21]",
