"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Progressive obstructive jaundice, pruritus, clay-coloured stools, and dull pain in RUQ in late stage.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Transaminases, PT/INR, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) are usually normal or mildly elevated. Patients typically have an elevated bilirubin, an elevated alkaline phosphatase, and an elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase.CA 19-9 may be elevated.There may be dilated bile ducts on ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen.Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is very helpful in diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Hepatic adenoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These patients usually are asymptomatic but rarely may present with acute abdominal pain, RUQ tenderness, and shock due to haemoperitoneum.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> On ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen, the adenoma appears as subcapsular hypo-echoic lesion and is very well circumscribed. Doppler blood flow shows venous pattern instead of arterial hypervascularisation pattern of hepatoma.Patients generally have a normal AFP.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Haemangioma of liver</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically asymptomatic. Acute abdominal pain can result from thrombosis or bleeding within the haemangioma due to the stretching and inflammation of the Glisson capsule of the liver. Patients do not have any coexistent chronic liver disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal LFTs and normal AFP.The majority of hepatic haemangiomas are well demarcated, smooth, and hypodense with a homogeneous appearance on ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI of the abdomen. MRI is very sensitive and specific for this disease.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may present with abdominal pain and/or palpable mass in the abdomen. It is not associated with chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or hepatotoxins.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> LFTs and AFP are usually normal or slightly elevated.Typical stellate central scar is the finding on CT scan or MRI of the abdomen. However, CT scan of the abdomen is the preferred test for diagnosis, staging, and postoperative follow-up. There may be regional lymph node involvement in 50% to 70% of cases due to aggressiveness of the tumour.Typical liver histology includes pattern of nests, sheets, or cords of malignant cells separated by lamellar bands of dense, hypocellular, and collagen connective tissue.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> One third of patients may have abdominal discomfort or palpable liver mass.There is no history of chronic liver disease in patients with FNH.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> LFTs and AFP are within normal range in these patients.Presence of central scar on ultrasound, CT scan, MRI scan, or technetium sulphur colloid scanning of abdomen is very diagnostic.There is no requirement of tissue diagnosis to confirm FNH.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Metastatic liver disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may have signs and symptoms of primary cancer, but in many cases are diagnosed at the time of liver metastasis. The liver may be the site of metastasis from virtually any primary malignant neoplasm, but the most common primary sites are colon, stomach, pancreas, breast, lung, neuro-endocrine tumours, and eye.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen is very sensitive (80% to 90%) and specific (99%) in differentiating metastatic liver cancer from hepatoma. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan, PET scan, and CT arteriography of the abdomen are very helpful in diagnosing liver metastatic disease, but they are not required.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Hepatic cyst</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cysts are usually incidental findings; they do not cause any symptoms until they become enlarged (&gt;5-6 cm). There is no association with chronic liver diseases or viral hepatitis leading to liver cysts.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> On ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen, simple cysts appear as thin wall cysts. Hydatid cysts usually have daughter cysts. Polycystic liver-disease patients have multiple cysts. Unlike hepatoma, cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma does not usually have any calcification, and these cysts usually have internal septations.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms are non-specific, including weight loss or RUQ discomfort. There is no association with chronic liver disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> LFTs are normal unless patients have advanced disease.Doppler ultrasound or CT of the abdomen shows vascular lesion.Histology is diagnostic and usually positive for endothelial markers factor VIIIR:Ag (vWF), CD34, and CD31.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Liver abscess</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Associated with fever and RUQ tenderness, which is acute in onset. There is no association with chronic liver disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Air-fluid levels can be seen on imaging studies.Patients usually have normal AFP.Cultures are diagnostic but can be normal.</p>",
