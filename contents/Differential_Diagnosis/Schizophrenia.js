"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Substance-related disorders are great imitators of psychopathology. Delusions are not as crystallised as in schizophrenia, but auditory hallucinations may still be present. A drug history should include evaluation of the duration, frequency, dosage, and time since last use. [62]The drugs most often associated with psychosis are heavy and persistent use of marijuana; stimulant drugs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and amphetamines; psychotomimetics such as LSD and ketamine-like drugs; and inhalants such as toluene, gasoline, and various types of glues.Past history of extensive use may result in long-term persistent psychotic symptoms, years after the last exposure.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Delusions may be similar, but are without a history of psychosis prior to dementia onset. An older age, family history of dementia and gradual cognitive decline suggests dementia.",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A schizophrenia diagnosis is given in patients with PDD only if prominent delusions and hallucinations occur for at least 1 month (or less if treated successfully).Clinicians should gather a childhood history, looking for pervasive deficits.In PDD, the debut of deviant interpersonal interactions, delayed and aberrant communication skills, and limited repertoire of activities and interests occurs in the first years of life. Childhood schizophrenia (before age 5) is rare, even though patients with PDD may experience hallucinations at one time or another.",

History and physical examination help differentiate diagnoses.",
