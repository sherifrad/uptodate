"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), but the age of onset is usually later and the clinical involvement milder.Patients are usually able to walk throughout their teens and into early adulthood.Occasionally, patients present with CHF before complaining of muscle weakness and before diagnosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy can be established by muscle biopsy that demonstrates a diminished quantity/quality of dystrophin.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Before DNA and dystrophin analysis, LGMDs was often misdiagnosed as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). [13]Onset of LGMD can be at any age and is equally expressed in either gender.Initial involvement is of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles; however, the pattern of muscle weakness can be clinically indistinguishable from that of DMD.Calves can also be hypertrophic, and some patients walk only on their toes from infancy.Rate of disease progression is highly variable. Severe disability, muscle contractures, skeletal deformities, and need for ventilator use are common, and cardiomyopathy can occur in certain forms. [14]These patients appear to have no intellectual or cognitive impairment but have an incidence of cardiomyopathy similar to that in other muscular dystrophies. [15]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CK levels are usually lower than those in DMD.Identification of deletion or mutation of relevant gene with DNA analysis confirms the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Musculotendinous contractures tend to be severe by comparison with muscle weakness, and the cervical spine tends to be hyper-extended with the entire spine rigid.Early contractures are seen at the neck, elbow, and Achilles tendons.Abnormal fat distribution (lipodystrophy) occurs in some laminopathies, as does humeropelvic or humeroperoneal weakness.Unlike people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), most patients are able to walk into the third decade of life.Cardiac arrhythmias are common and often life- threatening. This is probably related to the fact that emerin is normally expressed in the adhesive junctions of the heart. [16]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Emerin or lamin A/C gene mutation is seen in DNA testing.Immunolabelling of emerin is lost in X-linked cases.Conduction defects on ECG, especially AV block at the level of the AV node.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Polymyositis can occur at 4 to 7 years of age, and muscle contractures and weakness can become as severe as those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Muscle weakness usually occurs in the proximal muscles, especially those of the shoulder and pelvic girdles.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is established by characteristic muscle biopsy findings of inflammation, including mononuclear invasion of non-necrotic muscle, CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T cells, macrophages, and absence of perifascicular atrophy of dermatomyositis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The great majority of children who walk on their toes have static encephalopathies and at least mild spasticity. In many cases the children are asymmetrically affected.Children with DMD are hypotonic and tend to be symmetrically affected.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cerebral palsy is diagnosed clinically by the finding of CNS involvement marked by spasticity (not seen in neuromuscular diseases) as well as cognitive, motor, and sensory involvement.</p>",
