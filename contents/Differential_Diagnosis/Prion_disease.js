"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Generally a more chronic and rarely rapidly progressing dementia, but atypical cases can be mistaken for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). [83]CJD patients commonly present after 60 years of age, with deficits in memory and cognition in the absence of other disorders.Clinical features of CJD that are not commonly seen in AD include subacute onset and/or difficulty in co-ordination early on in the course. [84]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> AD is a clinical diagnosis. The clinical history, performance on neuropsychological testing, and pattern of brain MRI atrophy, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) hypoperfusion, or PET scan hypometabolism may support the diagnosis of AD. An MRI that is diagnostic for CJD may rule out AD. View imageView imageView imagePET scanning with Pittsburgh compound B (may soon be a diagnostic test for AD. [85]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Lewy body dementia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In a research study with a large cohort, dementia with Lewy bodies was found to be the second most commonly mistaken dementia for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). [72]  [86]Like CJD, dementia with Lewy bodies is a neurodegenerative disease that can present with cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations or disturbances, and parkinsonism. [87]  [88]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> This condition is best distinguished from CJD by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), attenuated diffusion coefficient map (ADC), or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging on brain MRI.View imageView imageView imageSPECT or PET scan may also reveal low dopamine transporter uptake in the basal ganglia. [88]Periodic sharp wave complexes are rarely seen on EEG in the late stages of Lewy body dementia.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Frontotemporal dementia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Although frontotemporal dementia (FTD) typically has a faster course than most memory and ageing disorders, it is seldom as rapidly progressive as CJD.Patients usually present with a frontal syndrome, including behavioural, personality, and cognitive changes, before the onset of dementia. [89]  [90]  [91]Unlike Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), criteria for frontotemporal dementia exclude myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia. [92]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FTD is a clinical diagnosis. The clinical history, neurological examination, performance on neuropsychological testing, and pattern of brain MRI atrophy, SPECT hypoperfusion, or PET scan hypometabolism may support a diagnosis of FTD.An MRI (DWI and ADC sequences) that is diagnostic for CJD essentially rules out FTD.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Cortical basal syndrome (CBS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Another progressive dementia that typically has a slower course than Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).Visual, sensory, and motor deficits of cortical basal degeneration may initially suggest CJD. [60]  [93]CBS is typically due to an underlying pathology of cortical basal degeneration or AD, and rarely CJD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CBS is a clinical diagnosis, usually with an underlying pathological diagnosis of CBD or AD. The clinical history, neurological examination, performance on neuropsychological testing, and pattern of brain MRI atrophy, SPECT hypoperfusion, or PET scan hypometabolism may support a diagnosis of CBS.An MRI that is diagnostic for CJD rules out CBS.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Vasculitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vasculitides can cause dementia or encephalopathy when they affect the CNS. These disorders can be distinguished from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) by the presence of systemic or peripheral nervous system signs such as fever, weight loss, neuropathy, and organ involvement.Criteria used in the diagnosis of such disorders have been established by the American College of Rheumatology. [60]  [94]  [95]  [96]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ESR and CRP are elevated.RF and ANA are positive.Perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA) and cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA) are positive.Brain angiogram demonstrates an intermittent narrowing 'sausage' appearance not seen in CJD.CSF may show evidence of inflammation, such as pleocytosis.Meningeal and brain biopsy shows inflammation of the blood vessels with lymphocytic infiltrate that is not present in CJD.Although serological rheumatological evaluation should be performed for elevated auto-antibodies, in isolated CNS vasculitis, these blood tests may be negative and systemic signs may be absent.

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Autoimmune disorders that mimic prion diseases include paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and non-paraneoplastic autoimmune limbic encephalitis. [98]Paraneoplastic limbic encephalopathies typically occur in 2 forms: antibody-mediated autoimmune conditions or non-antibody autoimmune-mediated causes such as systemic (but non-CNS) cancers.Paraneoplastic disorders may present in patients with known or FHx of cancer, or even precede the detection of cancer entirely.If a paraneoplastic condition is suspected, body CT imaging with contrast is indicated. [60]  [99]  [100]  [101]About 30% of these patients also present with seizures. [98]  [99]  [100]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum and CSF should be tested for elevated tumour markers and the presence of paraneoplastic antibodies.ESR and CRP are elevated.RF and ANA are positive.P-ANCA and C-ANCA are positive.Tumour markers such as CEA, CA-125, or PSA may be elevated.Paraneoplastic antibodies present: anti-Hu (ANNA-1), anti-Ta (anti-Ma2), anti-CV2 (anti-CRMP-5), anti-amphiphysin, anti-Yo (PCA-1), anti-nCMAg, anti-Ma1, anti-Ri (ANNA-2), anti-AMPAR, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), anti-voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)-associated antibodies.</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Limbic encephalopathy can also be due to autoimmune antibody-mediated causes not associated with cancers, as seen in anti-VGKC antibodies and other antineutrophil antibodies, and Hashimoto's encephalopathy.Sometimes these antibodies are associated with cancers (paraneoplastic) and sometimes they are not (non-paraneoplastic). [98]  [101]  [102]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> VGKC and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies are elevated.Antithyroid peroxidase (ATPO) or anti-thyroglobulin (ATG) antibodies are markedly elevated.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Hashimoto's encephalopathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rare but treatable autoimmune disorder that is commonly mistaken for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Linked to chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, this disease should be suspected with the presence of elevated antithyroid auto-antibodies.Although this disorder is also a rapidly progressive dementia with many common features of CJD, it is distinguished by its fluctuating course and more common association with seizures. [98]  [103]  [104]Patients may be euthyroid, subclinically hypothyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid, but to make the diagnosis, patients must be treated so that they are in a euthyroid state. [102]Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion.As the antithyroid antibodies are not shown to be causative in Hashimoto's encephalopathy, other terms have been applied to this condition, such as non-vasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis and corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis.These autoimmune-mediated disorders are very important to identify, as they are readily treatable with immunosuppression, such as with high-dose corticosteroids. [98]  [105]  [106]  [107]  [108]  [102]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thyroid dysfunction may be present.Antithyroid peroxidase (ATPO) and/or anti-thyroglobulin (ATG) antibodies are positive.Brain MRI (ADC and DWI sequences) does not show the abnormalities seen in CJD.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Other metabolic conditions in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) differential include childhood metabolic disorders that may present in adults as dementia such as porphyria, adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, orthochromatic leukodystrophies, and Kufs' disease.Systemic symptoms associated with these conditions are usually slower progressing but may be accompanied by rapid cognitive decline. [109]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine porphobilinogens are elevated during episodes of porphyria.Skin biopsy with electron microscopy is recommended for Kufs' disease diagnosis.Urine arylsulfatase levels are depressed in metachromatic leukodystrophy.Serum long-chain fatty acids are elevated in adrenal leukodystrophy.</p>",

"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> When patients present with recent-onset dementia of unknown aetiology, a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy work-up should be done.Metabolic disturbances such as certain vitamin deficiencies or rapid sodium shifts (causing extrapontine myelinolysis) can produce rapidly progressive dementia.A thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency should be urgently considered in patients who are nutritionally deprived with neurological signs.Inadequate thiamine in the nervous system can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy, which presents with nystagmus, ataxia, and memory loss.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Erythrocyte thiamine level is low.Brain MRI (T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI, and ADC) may show abnormalities (restricted diffusion) in the mammillary bodies, thalami, periaqueductal white matter, and/or tectum. MRI findings in vitamin B1 deficiency have some overlap with those in sCJD, including restricted diffusion in the thalamus and other deep nuclei.</p>",

"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Deficiencies of niacin or vitamin B3 (or the amino acid tryptophan, which is converted into niacin), may result in pellagra, which may present as a triad of dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia.Although the onset of pellagra is more insidious (death within a few years), it should be considered in nutritionally compromised (particularly low-protein intake) patients with dementia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nicotinic acid metabolites in the urine can confirm diagnosis; patients are treated with niacin supplements.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In general, all patients with dementia should be tested for vitamin B12 levels, as this condition can respond to treatment. [110]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Low serum vitamin B12.The hallmark of diagnosis is the presence of a macrocytic anaemia with macro-ovalocytes in the peripheral blood smear.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Vitamin E deficiency</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vitamin E deficiencies can occur in people who are unable to absorb or metabolise fat-soluble vitamins.In rare cases, it is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene. This deficiency can cause ataxia and other movement disorders such as dystonia. It is rarely rapidly progressive and often presents similarly to Friedreich's ataxia.When it is diagnosed early, treatment with vitamin E can prevent progression. [111]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum vitamin E level is low.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section14'>Wilson's disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Wilson's disease is due to an autosomal recessive mutation that hinders copper metabolism.The accumulation of copper in the tissues eventually causes dementia and liver disease, and generally presents in the teenage years, but almost always in patients &lt;50 years of age.Although not rapidly progressive, it is important to consider this in younger adults with cognitive, behavioural, and/or movement disorder, as it is very treatable. [112]  [113]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum and urine copper elevated.Blood ceruloplasmin is low.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section15'>Heavy metal intoxication</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Heavy metal intoxication, especially with acute exposure, can lead to rapid cognitive decline.In contrast to rapidly progressive dementias, which progress over weeks to months, these encephalopathies can progress within hours to days.Patients being treated with bismuth (a metal used to treat GI disorders) should also be tested for toxicity. Often mistaken for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bismuth intoxication can cause ataxia, apathy, and eventually myoclonus, speech problems, and change in mental status. If not treated, this condition can lead to permanent tremors and/or death. [114]  [115]  [116]  [117]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients should be screened for arsenic, mercury, aluminium, lithium, bismuth, and lead toxicities.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section16'>Hepatic encephalopathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section16'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hepatic encephalopathy should be clinically easy to distinguish from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) because of presence of severe underlying liver disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum lactate and ammonia elevated.The EEG in hepatic encephalopathy may show periodic sharp waves similar to CJD.</p>",

"<dd id='Section18'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Spirochete infections are an unusual but treatable cause of dementia. Patients should be tested for Treponema pallidum or neurosyphilis, as cognitive dysfunction is a late complication of syphilis. [118]Patients generally do not present with the combination of cognitive, motor, vision, and behavioural abnormalities as seen in CJD, but there is some overlap. Also, they generally do not have rapidly progressive dementia.",

"<dd id='Section19'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lyme disease is an infection caused by a tick bite containing the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Neurological and psychiatric manifestations in this systemic infection occur with neurological involvement. [119]Although rarely reported as a rapidly progressive dementia, it should still be considered, as it is readily treatable. [120]  [121]  [122]Typically presents as a skin lesion indistinguishable from erythema migrans, and is principally found in the southeast and south central regions of the US.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Whipple disease, a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whippelii, interferes with many body systems and can manifest as a neuropsychiatric syndrome.Typically occurring at around 50 years of age, this condition predominantly affects men and can vary in its clinical presentation. Most commonly, patients present with gastrointestinal disturbances, cognitive impairment, and problems walking.May be mistaken for progressive supranuclear palsy due to the behavioural and eye movement abnormalities. [123]Once Whipple disease is diagnosed, patients can be treated with antibiotics. [124]  [125]",
