"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations: specifically, decreased vibration sense, peripheral neuropathy, gait abnormalities, dementia, depression, and visual impairment.Clinical and haematological response to treatment confirms diagnosis.",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Gradual-onset fatigue often present, and 20% of patients have splenomegaly. May be associated with prior chemotherapy or radiation exposure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Macrocytic anaemia may be associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.Peripheral smear findings include dimorphic anaemia; large, hypogranular platelets; hypogranulated, hyposegmented neutrophils with Dohle bodies; and circulating myeloblasts.Bone marrow shows dyserythropoiesis; hypogranulated, hyposegmented granulocytic precursors; increased myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing fewer or disorganised nuclei. Ringed sideroblasts are seen in the bone marrow in certain sub-types of myelodysplastic syndrome.Cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation can identify chromosomal abnormalities.</p>",
