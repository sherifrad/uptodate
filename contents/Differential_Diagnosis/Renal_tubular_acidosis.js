"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are most often asymptomatic.Patients with liver cirrhosis or pregnancy commonly have respiratory alkalosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The key to differentiating between RTA and respiratory alkalosis is the arterial blood pH. In RTA the pH is always low. When serum bicarbonate is low, an arterial pH of 7.37 or greater indicates the diagnosis is respiratory alkalosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Diarrhoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients differ from those with RTA due to the presence of a low urine pH and a large negative urine anion gap. Similar blood and urinary laboratory findings occur after the ingestion of ammonium chloride. The evidence of normal urinary acidification excludes RTA in these cases.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be confused with Fanconi's syndrome. Patients with renal glycosuria exhibit glycosuria at normal serum glucose levels, but do not have acidaemia, bicarbonaturia, aminoaciduria, or phosphaturia. May be acquired or congenital.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, normal serum phosphate, and normal measurements of urinary bicarbonate, phosphate, and amino acid excretion.</p>",
