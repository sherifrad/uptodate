"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Oppositional defiant disorder</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More hostile behaviour, anger, open defiance (at home and school), openly rebellious. Most behaviours are directed at an authority figure. The diagnosis of ODD is not assigned if symptoms exist along with mood or psychotic disorder. May often precede conduct disorder. [40]Careful history and mental status examination with collateral information will help to distinguish from ADHD.Referral to a psychiatrist should be considered.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical. The Conners rating scale and the child behaviour checklist both have ODD domains.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Psychosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia include a mixture of positive symptoms (delusions, auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganised speech) and negative symptoms (thought blocking or slowed thinking, flat facial expression) that persist for a significant amount of time during a 1-month period.Psychotic disorders are associated with marked social, academic, or occupational dysfunction. [1]Careful history and mental-status examination with collateral information will help distinguish from ADHD.Referral to a psychiatrist is indicated.",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Autism spectrum disorder (includes pervasive developmental disorders)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The most striking feature of patients with autism spectrum disorders is impaired social interaction, a restricted range of interests, and difficulty adapting to new situations. Language development is often significantly delayed, though social impairment can be the most prominent delay in Asperger's syndrome. [1]Careful history and mental-status examination with collateral information will help to distinguish from ADHD.Referral to a psychiatrist, a neurologist, or a developmental paediatrician should be considered.",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Mental retardation</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Defined as an IQ significantly below average (&le;70) in addition to significant limitations in adaptive functioning in 2 of the following areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety. [1]Mental retardation can be distinguished from ADHD by its greater impairment in areas other than inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Referral to a psychologist for IQ testing.Genetic testing may be performed if there is suspicion of a chromosomal abnormality (e.g., Down's syndrome, fragile X).Imaging, thyroid function tests, and metabolic work-up may help elucidate the cause of the disorder.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Iron deficiency anaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Iron deficiency anaemia can lead to pallor, fatigue, irritability, and anorexia. Skin findings include angular stomatitis (cracking at the corner of the mouth), glossitis (tongue inflammation), and spooning of the fingernails. Neurocognitive deficits can also occur and may be irreversible.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC will show microcytic anaemia (MCV &lt;80 femtolitres).Iron deficiency can be demonstrated by lower transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron-binding capacity x 100), lower serum ferritin, or higher soluble transferrin receptor. [42]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Fetal alcohol syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Antenatal exposure to alcohol can have toxic effects on the fetal brain and lead to impaired cognitive development and higher levels of ADHD.In contrast to ADHD, however, patients with fetal alcohol syndrome often have a distinct facial appearance (smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, upturned nose, epicanthal folds) and may have microcephaly and shorter stature. [43]Antenatal history of alcohol exposure can be obtained by screening mothers with the T-ACE questions (tolerance, annoyance, cut down, eye opener). [44]Physical examination can detect facial abnormalities.",

"<dt><a href='#Section15'>Child abuse or other environmental stressor</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Psychosocial deprivation and stress are associated with increased risk of ADHD, but not all abused or neglected children have ADHD. [32]  [33]  When abuse is suspected, it is critical to screen children separately from their parents. A physical examination may assist in the diagnosis. Child-protection services must be notified and will gather collateral information.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skeletal survey can help demonstrate signs of physical abuse.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section18'>Medication adverse effects</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section18'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Certain medications can have cognitive adverse effects and this can be recognised by reviewing the medication list for suspect medication (e.g., antihistamines, sympathomimetics, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, theophylline, and phenobarbital).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum levels of some medications can be obtained (e.g., carbamazepine, theophylline, and phenobarbital).</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section19'>Substance abuse</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section19'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Intoxication or withdrawal from substances can mimic some of the hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness of ADHD. ADHD typically has onset before 7 years of age and is present throughout development and even into adulthood, while experimentation with substances occurs generally in adolescence and adult life. Careful history and physical examination can distinguish isolated substance abuse from ADHD, although the two are often comorbid.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine and serum toxicology screens.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section20'>Sleep disorder</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section20'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sleep disorders affect 25% to 50% of children with ADHD, so it is difficult to distinguish a sleep disorder from ADHD with sleep problems. People with sleep disorders can be inattentive or hyperactive. [47]A careful sleep history including review of time to sleep onset, awakenings at night, and sleep hygiene may identify a sleep disorder.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sleep studies can give a more definitive diagnosis.</p>",
