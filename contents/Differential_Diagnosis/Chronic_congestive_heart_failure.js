"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Ageing, deconditioning, and/or obesity may cause a reduction in effort tolerance due to dyspnoea and/or fatigue, but without the additional major and minor criteria for diagnosing heart failure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elucidation of the precise reason for exercise intolerance can be difficult because several disorders may co-exist in the same patient. Echocardiography in heart failure shows characteristic signs of heart failure. However, a clear distinction can sometimes be made only by measurements of gas exchange or blood oxygen saturation or by invasive haemodynamic measurements during graded levels of exercise (i.e., cardiopulmonary exercise test with VO2max).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dyspnoea may be episodic, with or without environmental triggers, and is usually accompanied by cough, wheezing, sputum, and a history of smoking or industrial exposure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary function tests will give definite diagnosis of an obstructive pulmonary disease. Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels may be intermediate (100 to 400 nanograms/L or 100 to 400 picograms/mL) in COPD.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sudden onset of chest pain, dyspnoea, and haemoptysis, especially after childbirth, [82]  are suggestive of PE.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG is abnormal in the majority of patients with PE and may show a deep S wave in lead I and a deep Q wave and T-wave inversion in lead III (S1-Q3-T3). Other common changes include sinus tachycardia, complete or incomplete right bundle-branch block (RBBB), and T-wave inversion in the inferior (II, III, aVF) or the anterior leads (V1 to V4).Normal levels of D-dimers can help to exclude PE, but raised levels occur in many types of cardiomyopathies as well as in PE.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients most commonly present with dyspnoea, but other frequent complaints include cough, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, haemoptysis, and chest discomfort, which are also common symptoms of pulmonary embolism. [82]  PPCM is defined on the basis of 4 criteria: 1) development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery; 2) absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure; 3) absence of recognisable heart disease before the last month of pregnancy; 4) left ventricular systolic dysfunction shown on echocardiograph. A number of potential risk factors may point to the diagnosis of PPCM, including age &gt;30 years, multiparity, women of African descent, pregnancy with multiple fetuses, a history of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia/post-partum hypertension, and maternal cocaine misuse.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In the presence of raised D-dimers (commonplace in pregnancy) and positive risk factors for thromboembolic events, echocardiography will identify the underlying left ventricular systolic dysfunction and point to the diagnosis of PPCM. It usually shows left ventricular enlargement and significant global reduction in ejection fraction. Other findings may include left atrial enlargement, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small pericardial effusion.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urinalysis shows proteinuria, and serum albumin is reduced. Twenty-four-hour urine collection shows &gt;3.5 g protein. Serum urea and creatinine clearance may be abnormal in later stages. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be raised. Kidney ultrasound and biopsy may reveal the underlying cause.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG may show electrical alternans or ST elevation and T wave flattening or inversion. Echocardiography may detect pericardial effusion, tamponade, and pericardial fibrosis. CT scan or MRI may show thickened pericardium. Pericardial biopsy may reveal underlying cause.</p>",
