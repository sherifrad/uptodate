"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Genetic haemochromatosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients usually present with hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and darkened skin pigmentation. As the iron deposits continue in other tissues (pancreas, heart, and pituitary) leading to progressive damage and dysfunction, additional complications may ensue (diabetes, dysrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and haemolytic anaemia).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Increased hepatic iron concentrations and raised serum ferritin levels.Genotyping: C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity.Histology: qualitative and quantitative hepatic iron determination.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical manifestations related to the lung, the liver, and, much less often, the skin.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis of severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is confirmed by a serum level below 9.2 to 14.7 micromol/L (50 to 80 mg/decilitre) in combination with a severe deficient genotype, generally determined by isoelectric focusing.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Reduced serum ceruloplasmin levels (&lt;200 mg/L (20 mg/decilitre)) in a patient who also has Kayser-Fleischer rings is considered to be diagnostic.Additional findings: serum copper decreased with excessive urinary copper excretion.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section14'>Granulomatous hepatitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section14'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Granulomas in the liver are associated with a number of disorders. Infectious disorders are the most important: bacterial (e.g., TB and other mycobacterial infections, brucellosis, tularaemia, actinomycosis); fungal (e.g., histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis); parasitic (e.g., schistosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, visceral larva migrans); less common viral infections (e.g., infectious mononucleosis, CMV); and numerous others (e.g., Q fever, syphilis, cat-scratch fever).Sarcoidosis is the most important non-infectious cause; liver involvement occurs in about two thirds of patients and occasionally is the dominant clinical manifestation. Hepatic granulomas can also occur in polymyalgia rheumatica and other collagen-vascular diseases, in Hodgkin's disease, and some other systemic conditions.",

"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The skin, liver, GI tract, and the haematopoietic system are the principal target organs in patients with acute GVHD. Hepatic involvement is manifested by abnormal LFTs, with the earliest and most common finding being a rise in the serum levels of conjugated bilirubin and alk phos.Although the concurrent presence of the characteristic rash provides suggestive clinical evidence, biopsy is the most definitive method to diagnose GVHD of the liver.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> LFTs consistent with cholestasis, with elevations in the serum alk phos and bilirubin concentrations.Histology: lymphocytic and granulomatous infiltrates of bile ducts; ductopenia.</p>",
