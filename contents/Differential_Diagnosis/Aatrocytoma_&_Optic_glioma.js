"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May or may not have systemic disease and/or known history of cancer.Systemic symptoms include cachexia, respiratory problems, haemoptysis, chest pain, and bone pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI: typically, more localised lesions that may be multiple, and with proportionally more vasogenic oedema.Chest-abdominal CT scan, bone scan, and PET scan provide evidence of systemic disease.Histology provides a definitive diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May or may not have systemic symptoms such as fever, cachexia, and chills.Risk factors differ and may include pulmonary abnormalities, congenital cyanotic heart disease, bacterial endocarditis, and penetrating head injury.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI demonstrates a thinner capsule toward the ventricle, with restricted diffusion of pus and elevated lactate level; may show multiple lesions.Blood tests suggestive of infection: for example, elevated WBC count, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), with sensitivity 90% and specificity 77%. [31]Biopsy or aspiration provides the definite diagnosis, demonstrating pus (inflammatory cells), no tumour cells, and a positive culture of bacterial agent or fungus.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents in women aged 20 to 40 years, with acute neurological symptoms that wax and wane (dissemination in space and time): for example, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis (spinal cord symptoms), and focal neurological symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI shows multiple lesions in the periventricular white matter; may or may not enhance.CSF shows oligoclonal bands.Histology provides the definitive diagnosis, demonstrating demyelinating lesions, inflammatory cells, and absence of tumour cells, but usually is not necessary.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Known brain tumour treated with radiotherapy in the past.May present with progressive neurological symptoms or no symptoms at all.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> PET scan is cold.Histology provides definitive diagnosis (no tumour cells and extensive necrosis).</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute onset of neurological symptoms.Often in older patients with cardiovascular risk factors.Rarely present with seizures (3% to 5% only).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI shows typical vasculature distribution and restricted diffusion.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Encephalitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Systemic symptoms present (fever and cachexia).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF shows leukocytosis, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) antibodies, and/or RBCs.EEG is characteristic with periodic lateralising epileptiform discharges.CT or MRI shows oedematous temporal lobes and haemorrhagic transformation.Brain biopsy is definitive with virus isolation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Oligodendroglioma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No specific difference in clinical presentation except that oligodendrogliomas are more prone to present with seizures.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan demonstrates calcification in 90% of cases.Cortical location on MRI.Histology provides definitive diagnosis with classic fried egg cytoplasm and chicken wire vasculature.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI demonstrates a cortical lesion with distinct margins.CT may show deformity over the calvaria.Histopathology provides definitive diagnosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents in the first 2 or 3 decades of life with seizure disorder.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI commonly demonstrates medial temporal lobe lesion with cystic components and/or calcifications.Histology is definitive with characteristic cell types: ganglion and glial cells.</p>",
