"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be difficult to differentiate clinically.Patients with SLE frequently present with an inflammatory arthritis with a similar pattern to RA, although it tends to be less symmetrical.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Joint x-rays demonstrate symmetrical, erosive arthritis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Antiphospholipid syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by the occurrence of venous or arterial thrombosis or recurrent fetal loss in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Antiphospholipid antibodies: anticardiolipin antibodies IgG or IgM present in moderate or high levels on &ge;2 occasions at least 6 weeks apart and lupus anticoagulant detected on &ge;2 occasions at least 6 weeks apart. These antibodies may also be positive in SLE.10% of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are b-glycoprotein positive. [61]Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test: false-positive result.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Raynaud's phenomenon is present in almost all patients with systemic sclerosis, being the initial symptom in about 70% of patients. Patients with SLE often have Raynaud's phenomenon as well, but these tend not to ulcerate compared to patients with systemic sclerosis.Patients with systemic sclerosis have characteristic sclerodactyly and calcinosis, not present in SLE.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Auto-antibodies: positive anti-centromere antibodies (limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis) or anti-topoisomerase 1 (Scl-70) antibodies (diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis).</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Auto-antibodies: positive anti-RNP antibodies are specific to MCTD.Patients with MCTD tend to lack other antibodies such as anti-Sm, anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-dsDNA.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Adult Still's disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A variant of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis characterised by seronegative chronic polyarthritis in association with a systemic inflammatory illness, which manifests as symptoms similar to those of SLE.The fever in adult Still's disease usually occurs once or twice daily with marked temperature elevation and normal temperature in between.The rash is often only seen during febrile periods and is a salmon-coloured macular or maculopapular non-pruritic lesion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated ferritin has been reported in most patients. Ferritin should therefore be checked in patients presenting with such symptoms and, if elevated, lead to a suspicion of adult Still's disease.Joint symptoms are similar to RA and joint erosions and fusion on x-ray may occur, unlike in SLE.</p>",
