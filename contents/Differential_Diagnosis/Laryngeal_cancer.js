"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms &lt;7 days, preceded by URI, and ordinarily self-limiting. May present with airway distress and high fever. Exudative tonsillopharyngitis with fever and anterior cervical lymphadenitis is highly suggestive of a bacterial origin.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Generally a clinical diagnosis, although indirect laryngoscopy may be performed to rule out laryngeal cancer. Chronic laryngitis lasting &gt;3 weeks should be referred to a specialist.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is often an associated infection of the oral cavity and oropharynx demonstrating signs of thrush.More common in patients who have hx of immunosuppression or who take corticosteroids (in particular inhaled corticosteroids).Neck masses are uncommon.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often associated with nasal congestion and obstruction, and dyspnoea on exertion. Patients may have a known diagnosis of sarcoidosis.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hx of known TB, PPD positive, known risk factors for TB infection (e.g., homelessness, incarceration, HIV positive).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laryngoscopy shows multiple nodular lesions (similar findings to laryngeal cancer). Biopsy and culture of lesions distinguish TB. [35]</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may present with nasal congestion, nasal crusting, cough and difficulty breathing, and haematuria. May have a known hx of Wegener's granulomatosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laryngoscopy shows acute, erythematous friable mucosa and subglottic narrowing. [36]  Biopsy of lesions is diagnostic; may demonstrate vasculitis. Serum tests of cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies may be diagnostic, but sensitivity is only 65% to 75%.</p>",
