"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A history of immobility or neuromuscular injury and exposure to succinylcholine (suxamethonium) is usually present. [33]Electrocardiographic abnormality (peaked T waves and/or bradycardia) evolves into fibrillation prior to elevation of carbon dioxide tension in blood or end-expiratory gas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Extreme hyperkalaemia can occur after the administration of succinylcholine to a patient with muscle disuse atrophy. Respiratory and metabolic acidosis are usually more marked than hyperkalaemia in a patient experiencing an early MH crisis.Resolves with treatment of hyperkalaemia with calcium.Muscle histopathology may have signs of denervation or necrosis.</p>",
