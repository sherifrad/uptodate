"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with LMN-only signs, involving 1 or both upper extremities.Might begin with severe weakness in a limb without significant atrophy, with atrophy occurring later in the disease course. [43]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrodiagnostic studies: multifocal nerve conduction block (with other locations than the usual entrapment sites). High GM1 ganglioside antibody titre (up to 80% of patients). [42]</p>",
