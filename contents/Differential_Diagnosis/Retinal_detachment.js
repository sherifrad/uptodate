"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Degenerative (peripheral) retinoschisis and rhegmatogenous RD can coexist in the same eye. However, retinoschisis is commonly bilateral and rather symmetric.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Indirect ophthalmoscopy with sclera indentation and slit-lamp biomicroscopy show that the fluid is intraretinal, rather than sub-retinal, and therefore does not shift with scleral depression. There is no pigment in the vitreous cavity; the retinal surface has a 'beaten-metal' appearance. [31]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Disease is usually symmetric between the eyes.Examination shows microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and neovascularisation on both sides of the horizontal raphe in the absence of collateral vessels. Vitreous haemorrhage is a common complication; this does not differ in its presentation from that seen in conjunction with a retinal detachment.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis.Fluorescein angiogram shows multifocal areas of non-perfusion.Ultrasonography may help identify the presence of a retinal break and absence of a retinal detachment.</p>",
