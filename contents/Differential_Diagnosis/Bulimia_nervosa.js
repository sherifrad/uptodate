"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype have the binge and purge behaviour. However, anorexia nervosa has as its key element a pathological fear of fat and weight gain leading to unhealthy weight loss. Bulimia nervosa does not.Body mass index and body fat are low in anorexia nervosa but not in bulimia nervosa. Patients with anorexia nervosa are much more likely to have hypothermia, bradycardia, and anaemia.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with irregularly recurring hypersomnia episodes in men aged 10 to 25 years. It is associated with psychiatric symptoms that include bingeing, sexual behavioural disorders, personality disorders, and mood disorders. [67]  It is very rare and usually occurs in Jewish males.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs concurrently in &ge;50% of cases of bulimia nervosa. Overeating can occur in MDD but the compensatory behaviours are fewer or absent.Depressed mood, reduced interest, weight change, insomnia, agitation, fatigue, and impaired concentration can be seen in both MDD and bulimia nervosa. Early morning wakening, guilt, and thoughts of death suggest MDD.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Anxiety, substance abuse/dependence, and personality disorders are common in patients with bulimia nervosa.Some patients may complain of or incorporate eating disordered behaviours to access treatment facilities available only to patients with eating disorders. These patients do not have a characteristic history (e.g., they may be able to go for periods of time without bingeing and purging).Comorbid disorders are differentiated by the degree to which their symptoms have an independent course and severity from the bulimia nervosa. Concurrent substance abuse/dependence may become apparent only because of drug withdrawal and impaired attendance, cognition, or behaviour.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Weight loss greater than 5% may suggest hyperemesis gravidarum. In bulimia nervosa, there may be a precedent history; bulimia typically improves with pregnancy in about two-thirds of cases (while worsening in about one-third).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.Weight loss due to hCG-induced hyperthyroidism needs to be excluded. In these cases, hCG is elevated, TSH is low, and T4 is elevated.Presence of chromosomal abnormalities, multiple gestations, gestational trophoblastic disease or hypdrops fetalis increases the risk of hyperemesis.</p>",
