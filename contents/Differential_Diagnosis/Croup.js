"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May or may not have antecedent symptoms consistent with croup; sudden deterioration following 2 to 7 days of a mild to moderate croup or other mild viral illness; [14]  fever, toxic appearance (child appears unwell and does not interact normally with his/her surroundings) may be present; painful cough; poor response to treatment with nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline). [20]  [21]  [22]  [23]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Radiological studies are contraindicated if there is clinical suspicion of bacterial tracheitis, as manipulation of the neck region and agitation may precipitate further airway obstruction.Bronchoscopy, performed at the time of intubation, shows erythematous tracheal mucosa, with thick, purulent tracheal secretions. [24]The most frequently isolated pathogens from tracheal secretions include Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and anaerobic organisms.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Radiological studies are contraindicated if there is clinical suspicion of epiglottitis, as manipulation of the neck region and agitation may precipitate further airway obstruction.Visualisation of the airway (prior to controlled endotracheal intubation) confirms the diagnosis showing an oedematous, erythematous epiglottis, often obstructing the view of the vocal cords.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Many foreign bodies are not radio-opaque, thus x-rays may not confirm the diagnosis.Direct visualisation and removal of foreign body in the operating room confirms the diagnosis.</p>",
