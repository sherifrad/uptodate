"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosed by exclusion of all other forms of chronic liver disease and histology, which is non-diagnostic for any particular disease entity. Circumstantial evidence indicates that NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the likely aetiology in a significant number of patients labelled with cryptogenic cirrhosis - that is, burned-out NASH. [40]  Other causes of cryptogenic cirrhosis include undiagnosed or burned-out autoimmune hepatitis, 'unknown' viral (non-A, non-B, non-C) hepatitis, and occult alcoholism.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Autosomal-recessive genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in tissues; results in neurological or psychiatric symptoms and liver disease. Wilson's disease manifests as liver disease in children and adolescents, peaking at ages 10 to 13 years, and as neuropsychiatric illness in young adults aged 19 to 20 years. Characterised by presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings on slit-lamp examination.",
