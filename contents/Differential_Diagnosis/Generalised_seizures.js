"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures will often present with continuous limb shaking similar to generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), but with suggestive elements: variable maintenance of consciousness, eye closure, side-to-side head shaking, pelvic thrusting, waxing/waning course, prolonged convulsive activity, lack of response to benzodiazepines.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Video-EEG monitoring is the definitive test to differentiate epileptic seizures from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.In the emergency setting, a prolactin level can be used as well; patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures will have a normal value.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vasovagal syncope can often present with brief convulsive activity (&lt;15 seconds) in the limbs shortly after loss of consciousness.A detailed history of the event itself is often useful and critical for the diagnosis; a typical syncope is often position-dependent and briefly preceded by a feeling of light-headedness. Further, the loss of consciousness is typically very brief, and there is a relatively quick return to baseline.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A tilt-table test can be utilised, but is a relatively non-specific assessment. Serum CK drawn serially can be used to differentiate from an epileptic seizure although it is not routinely used. [31]  This is because although a high CK would be suggestive of an epileptic seizure, a normal CK does not exclude one as unconsciousness with prolonged immobility for any cause can result in a high CK. In this situation, an accurate clinical history is seen as more important than any test.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Primary cardiac arrhythmias often present with sudden loss of consciousness, sometimes preceded by a feeling of palpitations or sudden anxiety. Generally, arrhythmias occur abruptly and without the prolonged evolution of convulsions that are typical of a GTCS. Additionally, patients with arrhythmia often return to baseline relatively rapidly.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An ECG is indicated for any patient with a potential cardiac arrhythmia. For those patients with a normal ECG and a high index of suspicion, a Holter monitor is warranted.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In some cases, TIAs can present with either a sudden alteration in consciousness or focal motor movements (limb-shaking TIA). Although these are rarely confused with GTCSs, they must be considered.A thorough history and neurological examination are indicated to evaluate for TIA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A non-contrast head CT or MRI can be used to assess vascular abnormalities that suggest a TIA. If available, an EEG can be used to evaluate for epileptiform activity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cataplexy presents with a sudden loss of tone during wakefulness and is sometimes included in the differential for seizures. This is rarely confused for a GTCS.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A polysomnogram and multiple sleep latency tests are utilised to diagnose narcolepsy with cataplexy.An EEG can also be used to evaluate for the possibility of epilepsy.</p>",
