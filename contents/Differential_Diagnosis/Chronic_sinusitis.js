"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No symptoms or signs reliably differentiate acute from chronic sinusitis. Both present in a similar fashion, although symptoms are generally less pronounced in chronic sinusitis. The distinction between the 2 is based upon the duration of symptoms (&lt;4 weeks versus &gt;12 weeks, respectively). Fatigue may be more common in chronic sinusitis, whereas fever and acute toxicity are associated with acute (bacterial) sinusitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No differentiating tests.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Allergic rhinitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clear rhinorrhoea, itching, sneezing, ocular irritation, and seasonality of symptoms suggest a predominant allergic component.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Scratch and intradermal tests show a positive reaction (oedema, erythema, wheal, and flare to positive allergens; RAST [blood] tests positive to allergens).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Allergic fungal sinusitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar symptoms; often unilateral.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan shows hyperdensities within opacified sinuses. MRI has classic appearance of dropped signal on T2-weighted images. Operative findings include thick 'peanut butter'-consistency mucus, while histology demonstrates non-invasive fungal elements and Charcot-Leyden crystals.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Sinonasal tumours (benign and malignant)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can occur in the sinuses, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx. Treatment for chronic sinusitis usually fails; symptoms are often unilateral and refractory. Constitutional symptoms may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT/MRI may show invasion or destruction of nearby structures that is suspicious for malignancy. Biopsy/tissue histology may reveal malignant cells. Histology differs widely according to multitude of benign and malignant neoplasms.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Turbinate hypertrophy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Predominant complaint is nasal obstruction, which often improves with topical nasal decongestion. Associated with allergy or nasal irritation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anterior rhinoscopy may show inflamed, swollen (hypertrophic) turbinates that respond to topical decongestion.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Foreign bodies</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common in children. Symptoms may be unilateral with specific onset.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Foreign bodies can be seen on anterior rhinoscopy, endoscopy, and imaging studies (e.g., CT). Associated mucosal inflammation and purulence may be seen.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Invariably occurs in adolescent boys, who present with nasal obstruction (often unilateral) with frequent nosebleeds.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nasal endoscopy shows vascular-appearing nasopharyngeal mass. CT and MRI will show mass centred in area of sphenopalatine foramen; often extending medially into nasal cavity/nasopharynx and laterally to involve pterygopalatine fossa and possibly infratemporal fossa.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Migraine</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms unique to migraine include photophobia, aura, unilateral pain (often throbbing), and visual disturbances. Some patients will not have the classic migraine symptoms but instead a mid-facial pain variant. Most patients presenting with primary complaint of headache or facial pain will fall into this category.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A normal sinus CT scan and unremarkable endoscopy serve as objective evidence against a sinonasal cause for headache. A trial of a triptan can be diagnostic for migraine as a cause for headache or facial pain.</p>",
