"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A syndrome of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and arthritis. These patients often present with fever of unknown origin (FUO) and occasionally have organomegaly and serositis (pericarditis, pleuritis).Iritis and subcutaneous nodules are rare.The rash is a fine, evanescent salmon pink, usually appears on the trunk, proximal extremities and, less commonly, on the face. The rash accompanies the spikes of fever and tends to disappear when the fever is down.These patients do not develop coronary artery aneurysms.Unlike with other forms of JIA, patients with systemic JIA are usually anaemic and have extremely high acute-phase markers (ESR and C-reactive protein), as is found in Kawasaki disease (KD).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presence of a positive rheumatoid factor (RF) or antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a rare occurrence.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Scarlet fever</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> An acute febrile illness caused by group A streptococcus.The patients usually have evidence of upper respiratory tract infection, mostly pharyngitis, accompanied by a diffuse, fine papular erythematous rash that appears on the trunk, extremities, and face, but with circumoral pallor.Resolution of the rash is associated with desquamation that starts in the face and progresses downward.Unlike in KD, in scarlet fever lips are spared and there is no conjunctivitis or conjunctival injection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive throat culture, or positive serological test for group A streptococcus (streptozyme and/or ASO), will confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Acute rheumatic fever</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> An acute illness that occurs 3 to 4 weeks following the onset of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.These patients develop migratory polyarthritis and more than 50% develop carditis. [23]Less commonly, the course may be associated with chorea, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum.There is no development of coronary artery aneurysms, but untreated patients will eventually develop chronic valvular disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive throat culture or positive serological test for group A streptococcus (streptozyme and/or ASO) will confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Toxic shock syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> An acute febrile illness that is associated with vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, strawberry tongue, and erythematous rash with subsequent desquamation.Many develop acute respiratory distress, hypotension, and shock.The disease is caused by staphylococcal or group A streptococcal infections.Unlike KD, most of these patients present at 15 to 25 years of age.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There is no diagnostic test for toxic shock syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical grounds.Isolation of staphylococcus or group A streptococcus serotypes that produce TSS-1 toxin will support the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Caused by the staphylococcal epidermolytic toxins A and B.There is a generalised skin erythema, with development of diffuse, sterile blisters and erosions; prominent circumoral erythema; and radial crusting and fissuring around the eyes, mouth, and nose.In addition, areas of epidermis may separate in response to gentle force (Nikolsky's sign). These changes may lead to secondary infection, sepsis, and electrolyte imbalance.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds.Identifications of strains 55 and/or 71 of staphylococci in cultures.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Stevens-Johnson syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A severe bullous form of erythema multiforme, also known as erythema multiforme major.It is characterised by high fever, pronounced constitutional symptoms, skin rash manifested by diffuse bullae, and mucosal membranes involvement.The severe explosive mucosal erosions and the widespread bullous skin lesion may differentiate this condition from KD.There is no development of coronary artery aneurysms, although these patients may benefit from high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There is no diagnostic test for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The diagnosis is on clinical grounds.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Drug reaction</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of exposure to the drug, presence of oral lesions or ulcers, periorbital oedema, and low acute-phase markers may help to distinguish it from KD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, although acute-phase markers (such as ESR and C-reactive protein) in KD are significantly higher than in an acute drug reaction.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Rocky Mountain spotted fever</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A febrile illness caused by rickettsial infection (Rickettsia rickettsii). The disease is transmitted by a tick bite and characterised by fever, headaches, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea, followed by severe myalgias.The hallmark of the disease is the rose-red blanching macular rash that appears first on the extremities, but subsequently spreads to involve the entire body, including palms and soles.After several days the rash becomes petechial or haemorrhagic, with evidence of a palpable purpura.In fulminant cases, multiorgan failure may develop, including myocarditis and renal or liver failure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, although confirmation would be achieved using indirect fluorescent antibody technique for R rickettsii.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Measles</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Unlike with KD patients, measles manifestations include exudative conjunctivitis, Koplik's spots in mouth, rash that typically begins behind the ears; patients usually also appear more unwell.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, although acute-phase markers (such as ESR and C-reactive protein) in KD are significantly higher, and confirmation of the viral disease would be achieved using antibody titres.</p>",
