"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of oesophageal reflux, systemic disease (e.g., telangiectasias, psoriasis), and recent intake of medications that can induce oesophagitis: for example, immunosuppression, corticosteroid, antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline), ferrous sulphate, and ascorbic acid.Physical examination may include the skin, looking for evidence of immunosuppression or systemic disease (e.g., telangiectasias, psoriasis), and the oropharynx, looking for ulcers, thrush, and leukoplakia.Although the patient may be asymptomatic, typical symptoms include odynophagia, dysphagia, retrosternal chest pain, and heart burn, together with 'coffee ground' emesis, anorexia, weight loss, cough, fever, and sepsis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: may show anaemia.HIV test: may be positive in high-risk patients.Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice because it allows mucosa visualisation, showing irritation/inflammation, brushing, and biopsy of the lesions.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Classic presentation is an episode of retching or vomiting followed by severe retrosternal pain and/or epigastric pain.History of alcohol intake is obtained in 40% of patients.During physical evaluation, it is important to look for subcutaneous emphysema, which may be absent in 10% to 30% of patients.Other common symptoms and signs include dyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, sepsis, and shock.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Conventional radiography of the chest may reveal free mediastinal, peritoneal, or prevertebral air. Pleural effusion, with or without pneumothorax, widened mediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema may be seen in late presentations.Pleural fluid amylase measurement is indicative of oesophageal rupture.Confirmatory tests include the following:Water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin), which is helpful to localise the lesion.CT scan may also be used as a confirmatory test, and findings include oesophageal wall oedema, peri-oesophageal fluid with or without bubbles, and widened mediastinum.Endoscopic evaluation should not be performed in a patient suspected of oesophageal perforation.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In an acute setting there is no way to differentiate both entities. However, patients with Cameron erosions may present with symptoms of persistent and recurrent iron deficiency anaemia (weakness, fatigue, dyspnoea). Manifestations of chronic iron-deficiency anaemia include angular cheilitis, glossitis, Koilonychia (spoons nail), and pallor.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: may show anaemia.Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice because it allows mucosa visualisation and biopsy of the lesions. Endoscopic diagnosis of Cameron erosions or ulcers is made when linear erosions or ulcers are seen inside the sliding hiatal hernia.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Peptic ulcer disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may present with upper GI bleeding or melena, without other symptoms. However, most patients describe a history of gnawing, burning, or hunger-like abdominal pain 40 to 60 minutes after eating, or less often before eating; patients also report nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue.History of medication use such as aspirin and NSAIDs.Helicobacter pylori is involved in about 60% to 70% of cases of gastric ulcer disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice because it allows mucosa visualisation, identification of the ulcer, and biopsy of the lesions.Serology tests, urea breath test, H pylori stool antigen test (HpSA), and gastric biopsy may help in the diagnosis of H pylori infection.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may present with upper GI bleeding or melena and a chronic history of gnawing, burning, or hunger-like abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting.History of smoking, alcohol intake, and/or medication use, such as aspirin or NSAIDs, is usually obtained.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice because it allows mucosa visualisation and biopsy of the lesions. Erosive gastropathy is characterised endoscopically by diffuse hyperaemic mucosa with multiple, small superficial areas of denudated mucosa called erosions.Serology tests, urea breath test, Helicobacter pylori stool antigen test (HpSA), and gastric biopsy may help in the diagnosis of H pylori infection as a cause of the gastritis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may present with or without upper GI bleeding (haematochezia, 'coffee ground' emesis with or without melena, and, in rare cases, haematochezia), progressive dysphagia initially for solids and then also for liquids, weight loss, early satiety, unspecific abdominal discomfort, and symptoms of persistent and recurrent iron-deficiency anaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: may show anaemia.Liver function test: may detect liver metastasis.Amylase: usually normal.Lipase: usually normal, elevated in acute pancreatitis; however, lipase is not completely specific for pancreatitis. Lingual, gastric, intestinal, and hepatic isolipases have been isolated.Radiological evaluation may include oesophagogram, upper GI series, or CT scan, each demonstrating an oesophageal or gastric mass.Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice because it allows mucosa visualisation of the mass, brushing, and biopsy of the lesions.</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Should be suspected in those with a history of heavy alcohol intake and/or a history of chronic liver disease who present with upper GI bleeding. Physical examination should reveal signs of chronic liver disease (i.e., asterixis, ascitis, pedal oedema, jaundice, splenomegaly, spider angiomas, gynaecomastia, Dupuytren's contractures, leukonychia, and discoloration of the nails indicating hypoalbuminaemia).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: microcytic anaemia and/or thrombocytopoenia.Liver function test: may be elevated in co-existing liver disease.PT/INR: may be elevated in cirrhosis of the liver or liver failure.Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic test of choice because it allows visualisation of the dilated veins in the lower oesophagus, as well as treatment of the varices.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Arteriovenous malformations</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually a massive bleeding and should be suspected in patients with a history of abdominal aneurysm or those with a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, who may give a history of a previous episode of mild 'coffee ground' haematemesis or melena usually self-limited weeks or months earlier (which is called the initial herald or sentinel bleeding).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: may show anaemia.Liver function test: may be deranged in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia of the liver.PT/INR: abnormal value may indicate a less favourable course of the disease.Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy should probably be the first test to be considered to rule out other causes of upper GI bleeding when the diagnosis of aortoenteric fistula is not clear. However, CT scan with contrast is probably the test of choice when aortoenteric fistula is highly suspected.Exploratory laparotomy may allow definitive aortoenteric fistula repair.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most patients report chronic, unspecific abdominal pain, which is described as a dull ache, throbbing, burning, or cramping pain that usually comes and goes. Symptoms can be partially relived with antacids. Eating may help or may increase symptoms. Weight loss due to lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting are common findings.",
