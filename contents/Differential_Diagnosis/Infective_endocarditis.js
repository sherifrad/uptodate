"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with rheumatic heart disease may present very similarly with predominantly constitutional symptoms. Jones criteria are diagnostic and consist of carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules, and evidence of preceding streptococcal infection. [18]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive antistreptolysin O antibodies or anti-DNAase B.Echocardiogram may demonstrate evidence of CHF with globalised carditis, but generally lacks specific vegetations seen with infective endocarditis (IE).Endomyocardial biopsy will reveal pathognomonic Aschoff bodies, which are persistent local inflammatory lesions.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may present with constitutional symptoms secondary to cytokine release or may have systemic disease secondary to embolic phenomenon.Often patients will describe waxing and waning symptoms as opposed to the subacute progressive nature of IE.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR may demonstrate characteristic calcifications within the heart or a small atrium.Echocardiography with subsequent histological examination is the most specific and sensitive test for diagnosis of atrial myxoma.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are commonly asymptomatic, and have history suggestive of a diagnosis of SLE.Patients with a positive antiphospholipid antibody may report repeated miscarriages, venous thrombosis, or thrombocytopenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Often will have positive auto-antibody profile including ANA, antidouble stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA), and anticardiolipin antibody with associated valvular disease.Immunohistochemical staining will demonstrate a lack of neutrophil and characteristic anti-inflammatory response seen in IE.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most common tumours producing NBTE are pancreatic, lung, and colon, so patients may report signs and symptoms consistent with those underlying conditions.Also may report symptoms of underlying hypercoagulable state such as recurrent DVT, accelerated atherosclerosis, pre-mature CAD, MI, or stroke. [19]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients often have underlying carcinomas or hypercoagulable state, so CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis may demonstrate a primary tumour responsible for underlying pathology, which is thought to be secondary to mucin production with subsequent embolic phenomenon.</p>",
