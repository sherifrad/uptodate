"<dt><a href='#Section15'>Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA disorder that affects primarily the optic nerves. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) can mimic ON. Visual loss is ultimately bilateral, either simultaneous at onset or sequential within 1 year. The temporal pattern of visual loss may be similar to ON, and visual acuity is often reduced to finger counting. Pain is seldom a feature of LHON. Occasionally there are associated subtle neurological abnormalities or white matter changes on MRI. Female carriers with a disease very similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) (with prominent binocular visual loss) have a LHON/MS overlap syndrome known as Harding's disease. [22]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Funduscopy acutely shows pseudo-oedema of the optic disc and peripapillary micro-angiopathy, which can be present in pre-symptomatic stages. More than 90% of familial cases are positive for primary LHON mutations affecting nucleotides 11778, 3460, or 14484 in mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process in cellular energetics.</p>",
