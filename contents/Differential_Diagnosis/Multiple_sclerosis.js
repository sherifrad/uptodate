"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs are present: increased reflexes (upper motor neuron) with atrophy and fasciculations (lower motor neuron).Visual changes are absent.ALS may involve dysphagia and pulmonary function abnormalities, but the dysphagia, unlike in MS, is usually accompanied by tongue fasiculations and dysphonia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> EMG is diagnostic of ALS. It is normal in MS unless there is a co-morbidity such as diabetes or B12 deficiency.Compressive lesions may resemble ALS and MRI of the spinal cord is recommended to exclude compressive syndromes; if MS is present, characteristic lesions are usually seen on MRI.Muscle biopsies are useful to exclude primary muscle pathology.</p>",
