"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In contrast with spinal compression fractures, focal kyphosis and height reduction are absent in muscular pain. Localised bony tenderness, which characterises the acute stage of a fracture, is also absent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging tests exclude underlying fracture.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Spinal claudication (pain in the buttock, thigh, or calf) is the classic symptom of central canal stenosis. It is more common in older patients. Pain and numbness usually occurs in 1 or both legs on walking and is relieved by spinal flexion, so that patients report less pain when sitting or leaning on a grocery cart.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI and/or CT can confirm central canal stenosis and may indicate other causes of low back pain.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differentiating pathological fractures from osteoporotic fractures can be difficult on the basis of clinical features alone.There may be other local or systemic signs and symptoms related to the primary tumour if malignancy is present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pathological fractures may be caused by tumour infiltration (e.g., multiple myeloma, metastatic disease) or other metabolic disease (e.g., osteomalacia).A bone profile is useful to determine a metabolic cause. This includes serum calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, phosphate, ALP, magnesium, creatinine; plasma PTH, serum 25OHD and 125DOHD, and plasma TmP GFR.MRI and CT may identify tumour pathology. Presence of a soft-tissue mass or signal change extending into the pedicle strongly suggests tumour. [34]  Blastic metastases appear hypodense on T1- and T2-weighted MRI images; lytic metastases are enhanced diffusely with contrast medium. [35]Bone scans may also show metastatic disease by revealing multiple foci of increased radionuclide uptake.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain may be referred to the back from visceral disease, such as aortic aneurysm, gastrointestinal disease, renal problems, and pelvic disease (prostatitis and pelvic inflammatory disease).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Physical examination, ultrasonography, and CT/MRI confirm the diagnosis. Aortic aneurysm should be suspected among older patients with coronary artery disease or multiple risk factors.</p>",
