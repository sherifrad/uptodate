"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Partial deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme within the cortisol biosynthetic pathway results in accumulation of androgenic precursors.Clinical presentation may be indistinguishable from that of PCOS.Certain ethnic groups are at risk: Yupik Eskimos, Ashkenazi Jews, and Hispanic, Italian, and Yugoslav women.Very rare in African-Americans.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A morning, follicular-phase 17-hydroxyprogesterone level &lt;6 nanomol/L (&lt;200 nanograms/dL) rules out the disorder. A value &gt;24 nanomol/L (&gt;800 nanograms/dL) rules it in. Intermediate values prompt cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation testing.Patients with non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia always have a stimulated (60 minutes) 17-hydroxyprogesterone value &gt;30 nanomol/L (&gt;1000 nanograms/dL) (usually &gt;45 and &lt;303 nanomol/L or &gt;1500 and &lt;10,000 nanograms/dL).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Thyroid dysfunction may lead to menstrual irregularities. However, unlike in most cases of PCOS, hyper-androgenism is absent.Clinical features of hypothyroidism (e.g., lethargy, cold intolerance) or hyperthyroidism (e.g., weight loss, nervousness, heat intolerance) may be present.",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Cushing's syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Circulating cortisol and androgen levels are elevated, resulting in obesity, hirsutism, acne, and menstrual irregularity.Usually with moon facies, central fat deposition, hypertension, muscle wasting, abdominal striae, and osteoporosis.Adrenal carcinomas in particular are inefficient at synthesising cortisol and can release large amounts of androgenic precursors, leading to severe hirsutism and virilisation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Screen for Cushing's syndrome with 24-hour urinary free cortisol (normal &lt;248 nanomol/24 hours [&lt;90 micrograms/24 hours] for radio-immunoassay or &lt;138 nanomol/24 hours [&lt;50 microgram/24 hours] for high-performance liquid chromatography ) or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (e.g., overnight: 1 mg at 11 p.m. or midnight), with 8 a.m. plasma cortisol the next morning. Normally a.m. cortisol is suppressed to &lt;138 nanomol/L (&lt;5 micrograms/dL) (&lt;50 nanomol/L or &lt;1.8 micrograms/dL with modern cortisol assays sensitive to detect 28 nanomol/L (1 microgram/dL)). An alternative screening test is late p.m. salivary cortisol.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Androgen-secreting neoplasms</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These are steroid-producing tumours of the adrenal or ovary.Autonomous androgen production often produces rapid-onset (within months) progressive virilisation (frontal balding, severe hirsutism, increased muscle bulk, deepened voice, clitoromegaly).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A baseline total testosterone &gt;6.9 nanomol/L (&gt;200 nanograms/dL) (or free testosterone &gt;0.7 nanomol/L [&gt;2 nanograms/dL]) warrants ultrasound of the ovaries (but may miss small hilus cell tumour).Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) &gt;7000 nanograms/mL should prompt CT scan of the adrenals.Some androgen-producing tumours may be associated with serum testosterone &lt;6.9 nanomol/L (&lt;200 nanograms/dL).Most women with testosterone &gt;6.9 nanomol/L (&gt;200 nanograms/dL) have PCOS or hyper-androgenism-insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans (HAIR-AN) syndrome. The rapidity of onset of virilisation (&lt;2 years) or onset late in life is a better predictor of neoplasm than androgen levels. [47]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is based on fasting insulin &gt;556 picomol/L (&gt;80 micro-units/mL) and/or peak insulin &gt;2084 picomol/L (&gt;300 micro-units/mL) during a 3-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, provided that beta cells are functional (reflected in normal glucose levels).</p>",
