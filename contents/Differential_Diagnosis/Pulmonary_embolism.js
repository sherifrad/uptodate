"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical cardiac chest pain is described as a retrosternal pressure or heaviness radiating to the jaw, arm, or neck.Pain may be intermittent or persistent.Differentiating risk factors include longstanding hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolaemia.Can be difficult to differentiate from PE on the basis of signs and symptoms alone.",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG does not show ST-elevation, but serum levels of cardiac biomarkers are raised.ECG may show non-specific ischaemic changes such as ST depression or T wave inversion.May see bilateral increased pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiograph consistent with CHF.Elevated troponin I or T. These may also be elevated in the setting of PE.Regional wall motion abnormality of the left ventricle on echo.</p>",
