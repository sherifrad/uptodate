"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More commonly seen in children.Patients demonstrate more renal failure and fewer neurological symptoms.Some experts believe that it is impossible to distinguish between TTP and HUS and that they are a continuum of a pathology, whereas others believe that they are distinct entities.Caution should be used in making this diagnosis because it would be harmful to withhold potentially life-saving plasma-exchange treatment if the true diagnosis is TTP.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Associated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection, which is detected in the stool.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Hypertension, malignant</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients can present with microangiopathy, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, and neurological dysfunction. However, it is extremely unlikely that a patient with TTP will present with severe HTN.Microangiopathic haemolysis in patients with malignant HTN clears and thrombocytopenia resolves with BP management.Patient will have severe HTN, for example, systolic BP &gt;200 mmHg, diastolic BP &gt;130 mmHg.",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>DIC</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> DIC patients typically appear more acutely unwell than patients with TTP. They can also have delayed bleeding after trauma, such as needle pricks.Sometimes DIC associated with occult or frank malignancies can be hard to distinguish from TTP. A search for systemic malignancy, including a bone marrow biopsy, is appropriate when patients with TTP have atypical clinical features or do not respond to plasma exchange. [30]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time with raised D dimer suggests DIC.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sepsis patients have hypotension, fever, and other signs of sepsis. Treatment of the underlying infection should correct the thrombocytopenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients often have more pronounced fever and raised white count with left shift. Peripheral smear might show vacuoles in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, which is highly specific for bacteraemia. Blood cultures might be positive.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These patients do not have renal insufficiency, neurological symptoms, microangiopathy, or fever, which are seen in patients with TTP.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peripheral smear is bland, other than the presence of thrombocytopenia. They should not have schistocytes.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> New BP elevation and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation in pregnant woman.Although pregnancy is a risk factor for TTP and proteinuria can be present, patients with TTP do not generally have raised BP.",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> It can be difficult to distinguish between TTP and HELLP syndrome in some pregnant women. HELLP is suggested by preceding proteinuria and HTN followed by pre-eclampsia. HELLP develops in the third trimester, whereas TTP can occur at any point during pregnancy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood work shows haemolysis with a microangiopathic blood smear, raised liver enzymes, and a low platelet count. Might have evidence of DIC on coagulation studies.</p>",
