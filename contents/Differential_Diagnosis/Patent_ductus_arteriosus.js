"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A venous hum can be heard usually more on the right side. In addition, it diminishes with supine positioning and with local compression.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Physical examination will distinguish a venous hum as described previously. If there is still sufficient concern echo can be performed. In the case of a venous hum the echo will be normal.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This murmur is also continuous. However, it is usually heard lower in the precordium. [2]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Can be distinguished by echo. On echo evaluation a coronary fistula will appear as a small continuous jet of flow into the right ventricle or main pulmonary artery. It can be distinguished by location.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These lesions can present similarly with regard to clinical history, ECG, and CXR findings. However, the murmur of most left-to-right shunts will only be heard in systole. The exception is an aortopulmonary window, which is a large connection between aorta and pulmonary artery and will present with clinical findings identical to that of a large PDA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echo can definitively distinguish these lesions by their characteristic appearance and location. Left heart enlargement if present will look similar in all these lesions.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Aortic regurgitation</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These patients often present at an older age. They can present with symptoms of exercise intolerance as well. The usually do not demonstrate tachypnoea. The murmur is characteristically a high-pitched diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Again echo can definitively distinguish aortic regurgitation from a PDA. On echo, the descending aorta may similarly demonstrate diastolic flow reversal depending on the degree of aortic regurgitation. However, a diastolic regurgitant jet will be seen at the level of the aortic valve.</p>",
