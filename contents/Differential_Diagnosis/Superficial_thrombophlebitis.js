"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute onset of swelling, warmth, redness, and pain that is more diffuse and can involve the whole leg. Palpable cord is not common along the course of affected vein unless there is concomitant superficial thrombophlebitis (SVT).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Doppler ultrasound (DUS): thrombus in the deep venous system will confirm diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Cellulitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Erythema is usually localised and confluent and associated with tenderness and generalised swelling. There may be associated lymphangitis or tender lymphadenopathy, which is not characteristic of SVT. A palpable cord is not present with cellulitis. Systemic findings of fever, chill, and myalgias are more common with cellulitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> DUS: compressible veins, absence of superficial vein thrombus.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Lymphoedema</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually chronic rather than acute non-pitting oedema of the extremity and involving the digits. Oedema does not resolve or improve with recumbency.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> DUS: compressible veins, absence of superficial vein thrombus; B-mode imaging shows subcutaneous oedema.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Chronic venous insufficiency</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually chronic leg swelling with associated ectatic veins, varicose veins, and skin changes that may include hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, panniculitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and venous ulcers.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis usually made on clinical examination.Confirmation on DUS: can show valvular incompetence and chronic venous obstruction.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Erythema nodosum</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most common form of panniculitis, usually consisting of raised painful bilateral tender lesions that are frequently located over both shins. There is no palpable cord.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy: septal panniculitis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosum</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A form of vasculitis consisting of nodules of a bright red to blue colour that follow the course of arteries. Usually bilateral and become confluent to form painful subcutaneous plaques.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy: necrotising vasculitis of the arteries.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Insect stings or bites</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Swelling and redness usually extend over a large area and do not follow the course of a vein. There may be associated pruritus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis usually made on clinical examination.DUS: negative for superficial vein thrombus.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Tendonitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually pain, mild swelling, and warmth in the area of a tendon (Achilles' heel, patellar). Pain increases with movement of affected joint, and a tendon friction rub may be palpable. Pain worse during and after activity, and the tendon and joint area can become stiff as the swelling impinges on the movement of the joint.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound: thickened, blurred tendon, and possible hypo-echoic foci within tendon.MRI: tendon injury.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Lymphangitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Erythema, warmth, and tenderness along the course of a lymphatic vessel from source of infection (e.g., cellulitis) to regional lymph nodes. Lymph nodes usually palpable.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> DUS: compressible veins, absence of superficial vein thrombus.</p>",
