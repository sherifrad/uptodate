"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presentation may be identical to that of gout.Is less common in people younger than 50 years of age.Is more likely to affect wrist and knee joints.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chondrocalcinosis (radiographic calcification of cartilage in certain joints) is usually present.The definitive diagnosis is finding calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the synovial fluid. These are rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presentation may be identical to that of gout.Occurs in both sexes and at any age.Risk factors for infection, such as intravenous drug use and immunocompromise, may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Synovial fluid microscopy and culture may be Gram positive and show growth.Blood cultures may grow the causal bacteria.Co-existence of crystals and infection in the joint is not uncommon.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A positive history is present.Usually, there are fewer inflammatory signs, such as erythema or warmth, on joint examination than with gout.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Chronic tophaceous and polyarticular gout may present like RA, and tophi can be misdiagnosed as rheumatoid nodules.History of intermittent, acute, self-limited attacks of arthritis and podagra suggests gout.RA and gout appear to be negatively correlated, as very few cases of co-existence have been reported.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Associated with positive RF in 70% to 78% of cases; however, 30% of patients with gout have a positive RF. [44]Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) is a new diagnostic test for RA. It has a high specificity, but a low sensitivity and it may be useful in the early detection of patients who will have severe RA. [45]Synovial fluid is inflammatory (WCC count &gt;2.0 x 10^9/L or 2000/mm^3 or 2000/microlitre), but no monosodium urate crystals are found.</p>",
