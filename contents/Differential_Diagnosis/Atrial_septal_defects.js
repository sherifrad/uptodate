"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Small ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are associated with a holosystolic murmur and normal first and second heart sounds. With a larger shunt volume (ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow, Qp:Qs, &gt;2), a mid-diastolic mitral valve flow murmur may be heard in addition to a holosystolic mid-frequency murmur.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Associated with prematurity. Patent ductus arteriosus is also associated with bounding peripheral pulses due to wide pulse pressure. The left ventricular impulse may be prominent. The murmur associated with a patent ductus arteriosus is often described as a machinery-like continuous murmur. However, in some premature and newborn infants the murmur can be heard only in systole. A mid-diastolic mitral valve flow murmur may be heard.",
