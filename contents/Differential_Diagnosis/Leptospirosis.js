"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presenting signs and symptoms similar to leptospirosis, except conjunctival suffusion, which is not present in dengue fever.Dengue fever does not present in 2 phases.",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar presentation in both haemorrhagic fever and leptospirosis.Haemorrhagic fever will occur after exposure to particular endemic areas, whereas leptospirosis is endemic worldwide.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive leptospiral testing confirms leptospirosis and will differentiate it from haemorrhagic fever. Diagnosis is confirmed by multiple PCR assays, serological tests, and viral isolation.</p>",
