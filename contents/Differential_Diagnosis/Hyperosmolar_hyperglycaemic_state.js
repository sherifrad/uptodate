"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are often younger, leaner, and are usually patients with type 1 diabetes.Abdominal pain is uncommon in hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic syndrome (HHS) but frequently seen (&gt;50%) in patients in DKA. [8]In the US, patients with ketosis-prone diabetes are almost exclusively African-American or Hispanic in origin. [39]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Venous pH &lt;7.3.HCO3 &lt;15 mmol/L (&lt;15 mEq/L); anion gap &gt;12 mmol/L (&gt;12 mEq/L).Presence of serum ketones or beta-hydroxybutyrate.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be clinically indistinguishable from HHS and DKA, although most patients do not have a history of diabetes.Sometimes occurs in association with HHS and DKA.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A history of chronic alcohol abuse is present.Produced by starvation due to poor food intake.Peripheral signs of chronic liver disease, such as spider naevi, leukonychia, palmar erythema, bruising, jaundice, scratch marks, and hepatomegaly, are present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Venous pH is variable and can be normal.HCO3 &lt;15 mmol/L (&lt;15 mEq/L) ; anion gap &gt;12 mmol/L (&gt;12 mEq/L).Serum glucose is low or normal but serum ketones or beta-hydroxybutyrate is elevated.Lactate levels are usually elevated but elevation is insufficient to account for acidosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of ingestion of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol (constituent of automobile antifreeze), and/or propylene glycol (diluent in many IV medications, such as lorazepam) is present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum methanol levels will be elevated. [3]Calcium oxalate and hippurate crystals in the urine suggest ethylene glycol ingestion. [3]Paraldehyde ingestion is suggested by its characteristic strong odour in the breath. [3]These organic toxins can produce an osmolar gap in addition to an anion gap due to their low molecular weight. [3]</p>",
