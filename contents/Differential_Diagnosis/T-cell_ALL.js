"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically, ALL and AML may be indistinguishable. Skin infiltration and gum hypertrophy are more common in AML. CNS, testis, and mediastinal involvement are more common in ALL.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In many cases, the leukemic cells of AML or biphenotypic ALL are poorly differentiated with minimal amount of cytoplasm. These cells are difficult to differentiate from those of ALL. [3]  [6]In such a case, bone marrow biopsy, peripheral blood smear, cytochemistry, and immunological marker may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis.The presence of myeloid markers and absence of lymphoid ones favour the diagnosis of AML. Scoring panels enable the diagnosis of biphenotypic leukaemia.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Infectious mononucleosis may present with thrombocytopenia, fever, malaise, pharyngitis, and, more commonly, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Parvovirus may present with anaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC: abnormal lymphocytes; CMV infection and Bordatella pertussis infection may present with significant lymphocytosis. [1]  [2]Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: normal haematopoiesis.Immunophenotyping may show increased numbers of haematogones (normal reactive B-cell progenitors).Epstein-Barr serology: positive.Viral testing: may be positive.Culture of nasopharyngeal secretions: may be positive.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: pulmonary mass.Biopsy: small-cell lung cancer appears histologically as sheets of small round cells with dark nuclei, scant cytoplasm, fine granular nuclear chromatin, and indistinct nucleoli. In addition, immunohistochemical staining reveals positivity for chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Skin lesions, local lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms suggesting dissemination (e.g., pulmonary or neurological symptoms).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy: the Merkel cell exhibits immunocytochemical properties of both epithelial and neuroendocrine cells. Immunoreactivity for intermediate filaments such as the cytokeratins may differentiate Merkel cell from other undifferentiated tumours.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Disseminated disease can mimic ALL. May be symptoms and signs suggesting primary site or other symptoms of metastatic disease (e.g., bone pain or respiratory symptoms).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Rhabdomyosarcoma: immunohistochemical staining (IHC) or electron microscopy may provide evidence supporting myogenic differentiation. IHC can detect muscle-specific proteins. [16]  [30]</p>",
