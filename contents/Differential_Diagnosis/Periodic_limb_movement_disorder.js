"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be associated with head-turning and involuntary upper limb movements. Postictal confusion may be mistaken for daytime somnolence.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> EEG may show evidence of seizure activity. MRI of the brain may demonstrate the structural lesion responsible for seizure activity.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Nocturnal arousals may occur secondary to sleep-disordered breathing. Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) may occur secondary to these arousals. A history of snoring, dry mouth on wakening, and morning headache may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Polysomnography will demonstrate nocturnal hypopnoea, apnoeas, or respiratory effort-related arousals. [1]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Sleep starts</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> These may be associated with brief contractures of the extremities during sleep.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> EMG recordings during polysomnography will differentiate between sleep starts and PLMD.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Body movements may occur as dreams and are re-enacted during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> PLMS predominantly occur during stages 1 to 2 of sleep, as demonstrated by EEG during overnight polysomnography. EMG will also differentiate between PLMS and other movements in RBD.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Restless legs syndrome (RLS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The main symptom of the disorder is the urge to move the legs, which is accompanied by symptoms of dysaesthesias such as creeping, crawling, tingling, cramping, or aching of the extremities. Due to the circadian timing of RLS symptoms, the dysaesthesias can cause insomnia, which can lead to increased sleepiness and tiredness, which in turn increases RLS symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An initial diagnostic work-up for RLS should include a serum ferritin level.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Iron deficiency anaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients usually present with fatigue, low energy level, pallor, or dyspnoea on exertion. History specific to iron deficiency as a cause of anaemia includes unusual cravings for ice or non-food items and RLS.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC (including haemoglobin and haematocrit, platelet count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, red cell distribution width) with peripheral smear, reticulocyte count, and an iron profile.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Obstructive sleep apnoea</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical presenting symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, restless sleep and episodic gasping, and episodes of apnoea during sleep.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Polysomnography is the definitive test for diagnosis.</p>",
