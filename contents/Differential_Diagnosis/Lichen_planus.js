"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Anatomic distribution favouring extensor surfaces of extremities; silver scale overlying plaques; reports of pinpoint bleeding within plaques.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Standard histology shows regular acanthosis, loss of the granular layer, thinning of the supra-papillary plates, dilation of blood vessels in the superficial papillary dermis, neutrophilic abscesses in the stratum corneum and/or parakeratosis. [46]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tense bullae on normal skin or skin affected by lichen planus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Standard histology shows cell-poor sub-epidermal bullae, often with lichenoid infiltrates at the bulla edges; eosinophils and neutrophils are also occasionally present. [46]Direct immunofluorescence shows linear IgG and C3 at the basement membrane zone with lichen planus pemphigoides.Indirect immunofluorescence using salt-split skin substrate causes immunofluorescence to localise at the roof of blisters.
