"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Blue or purple colour.Present at birth.Soft and compressible on examination. Proportionate growth.Non-pulsatile.Size may readily increase with dependent positioning.No spontaneous involution.May ache but is not usually tender. Thrombosis may cause acute swelling and tenderness.Phleboliths may be palpable as hard masses. [47]  [48]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Doppler ultrasound of lesion shows a sponge-like array of anechoic vessels with a venous waveform. [36]MRI with and without contrast shows venous lakes and phleboliths. [49]Laboratory studies may show low serum fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer, and low platelet counts indicative of chronic intravascular coagulopathy. [1]X-rays may show calcified phleboliths.
