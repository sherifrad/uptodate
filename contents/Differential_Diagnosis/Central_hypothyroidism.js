"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Absence of symptoms and signs of hypopituitarism such as CNS involvement (headaches, visual disturbances) or pituitary hormone excess (galactorrhoea, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Low free T4 is observed in both primary and central hypothyroidism.A high TSH would be expected in primary hypothyroidism, whereas in central hypothyroidism TSH is low, normal, or mildly elevated (normal 0.5 to 5.0 mU/L).A high serum antithyroid peroxidase antibody concentration suggests primary hypothyroidism.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Abnormal findings on thyroid function tests that occur in the setting of a systemic non-thyroidal illness (NTI) without pre-existing hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction.The key characteristics are those of the primary disorder.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The most prominent alteration is low serum T3.TSH, T4, and free T4 are also affected in variable degrees based on the severity and duration of the NTI.As the severity of the NTI increases, both serum T3 and T4 levels drop and then gradually normalise as the patient recovers.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Affected patients come from geographical regions where iodine deficiency disorders are endemic.Patients present with goitre, cretinism, and mental retardation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Occurs when dietary iodine intake is inadequate for thyroid hormone synthesis.TSH levels are increased, and there is an increase in the T3 to T4 ratio.A low 24-hour urine iodine collection &lt;394 nanomol/L (&lt;50 micrograms/L) is consistent with moderate deficiency.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Chronic fatigue syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with both hypothyroidism and chronic fatigue syndrome may experience prolonged fatigue as well as cognitive slowing and memory problems.Symptoms such as cold intolerance, weight gain, weakness, headaches, and visual disturbances suggest central hypothyroidism.Signs such as bradycardia, skin changes, and hair thinning are more consistent with hypothyroidism.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thyroid hormone levels are normal.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>de Quervain's thyroiditis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms of hypothyroidism are typical in de Quervain's thyroiditis, although most are transient. Local symptoms observed in de Quervain's thyroiditis, such as pain over the thyroid area and dysphagia, are not observed in central hypothyroidism.On physical examination, thyroid tenderness, enlargement, or firmness may be present in de Quervain's thyroiditis, but is not consistent with central hypothyroidism.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> TSH is typically elevated in the hypothyroid period of de Quervain's thyroiditis.Serum thyroglobulin and ESR are almost always markedly elevated in de Quervain's thyroiditis, especially in the initial inflammatory phase.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Depression</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Slow mentation, fatigue, decreased memory, and somatic complaints are common in both depression and hypothyroidism.Physical examination findings such as dry, coarse skin, periorbital puffiness, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes are not characteristic of depression.Comorbid psychiatric disorders are more common in those with depression.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thyroid hormone levels are normal.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms common to hypothyroidism and EMS include myalgias, arthralgias, skin changes (thickening of the skin), weakness, and fatigue, as well as difficulty with concentration and memory. [38]  [39]A history of acute inflammatory symptoms or prominent pulmonary symptoms suggests EMS.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The presence of blood eosinophilia is essential for the diagnosis of EMS. [38]  [39]  A polymorphonuclear leukocytosis is also common.Thyroid function tests are normal.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms common to central hypothyroidism and fibromyalgia include fatigue, depression, myalgias, and headaches (if central hypothyroidism is caused by a mass lesion).A history of generalised pain with specific tender points suggests fibromyalgia.",
