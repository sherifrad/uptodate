"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually not hypoxic or febrile, although a low-grade fever may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Leukocytosis and sputum production may or may not be present.Opacities on a CXR tend to be more linear than lobar shaped.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Pulmonary embolus</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More acute onset of SOB, possible hypoxia, and hypocapnia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Spiral CT scan positive; newer scans are better at detecting peripheral emboli.V/Q scans should be performed if a patient is unable to receive contrast.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>ARDS</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dyspnoea and tachypnoea are common before intubation. If ARDS is secondary to an infection, a fever will be present. Furthermore, fever is a feature of fibroproliferative ARDS.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The ratio of FiO2 to PaO2 &lt;200 supports ARDS in the context of a diffuse opacity.Patients are typically intubated and sedated and therefore a common method of diagnosis is generalised pulmonary opacity seen on CXR.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Pulmonary haemorrhage</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Haemoptysis with acute haemodynamic instability. Other non-specific pulmonary symptoms include cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain.There may be a history of Goodpasture's syndrome.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR would show diffuse alveolar filling in a perihilar or basilar distribution. However, this is difficult to distinguish from pulmonary oedema or a diffuse infectious process. Patient may be anaemic.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Lung cancer</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar symptoms but differentiating factor is that symptoms may have been present for many weeks.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A CT scan would be more likely to show neoplasm as a different morphology (nodular) with possible metastatic involvement of other tissue (bone).</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Pleural effusion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough may be severe; pleurisy may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A CT scan distinguishes fluid from atelectatic lung because the fluid is confined to the compartment of the pleural space, typically creating a well-defined line on imaging.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Heart failure symptoms include dyspnoea, jugular venous distention, an S3 gallop, and oedema.The concomitant presentation of HAP with an effusion or oedema makes diagnosis complicated.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR may show cardiomegaly, upper lobe diversion, fluid in the fissures, pleural effusion, and diffuse interstitial or alveolar shadowing.ECG may give clues as to the cause, for example, MI, ischaemia, or ventricular hypertrophy.Echocardiography can be diagnostic. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) may be elevated.</p>",
