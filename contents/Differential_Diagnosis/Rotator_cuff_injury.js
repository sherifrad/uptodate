"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Advanced imaging will not show rotator cuff tear; may show inflammation within tendons or bursa. MRI would also show some increased fluid in the subacromial space and the subdeltoid bursa, as well as increased signal.If the rotator cuff is intact, strength should improve after pain-relieving injection of anaesthetic.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can co-exist with an acute rotator cuff tear, but the symptoms for each diagnosis differ. Osteoarthritis results in painful glenohumeral stiffness and limitation of active and passive motion. In contrast, loss of passive motion in rotator cuff tear is uncommon. Degenerative changes can occur following untreated chronic massive rotator cuff, but such changes are relatively uncommon immediately following an acute tear.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays demonstrate typical changes of osteoarthritis (decreased joint space, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and osteophyte formation).</p>",
