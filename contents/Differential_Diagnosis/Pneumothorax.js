"<dt><a href='#Section1'>COPD, acute exacerbation</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fever, increased cough, and change in sputum colour suggest an infective exacerbation. Bullous pulmonary disease may, however, be clinically indistinguishable from pneumothorax. [34]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT of the chest may be necessary to differentiate a pneumothorax from a pulmonary bulla. [29]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Pulmonary embolism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presence of risk factors for thromboembolism, such as obesity, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy/postpartum period, inherited thrombophilias, active malignancy, recent trauma/fracture, and a history of previous thrombosis. Physical examination abnormalities suggestive of deep venous thrombosis are present in 50% of patients. [2]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The chest x-ray is most commonly normal, but pulmonary vascular oligaemia and atelectasis may be present. Pulmonary infiltrates may develop and can be of any shape, not just wedge-shaped.CT pulmonary angiogram with direct visualisation of thrombus in a pulmonary artery.Ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan) with an area of ventilation that is not perfused.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Myocardial ischaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically the patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath that is brought on by exertion. The chest discomfort is usually substernal and is described as a pressure sensation. Pain may radiate into the neck and down the arms. Nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis may accompany the chest discomfort.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An ECG may demonstrate ischaemia or injury patterns.Serum levels of CK-MB and troponin increase when myocardial infarction has occurred.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Pleural effusion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients will experience pain. However, as fluid accumulates in the pleural space, the visceral and parietal pleura will move apart and chest pain will ease. Physical examination demonstrates decreased fremitus, dullness to percussion, and decreased breath sounds. As pleural fluid accumulates, the patient may experience shortness of breath.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A chest x-ray is typically diagnostic of a pleural effusion. A meniscus sign at the costophrenic angle in an upright chest x-ray is diagnostic. Between 250 and 500 mL of pleural fluid is necessary to visualise effusion by chest x-rays.CT scans are more sensitive and may give additional clues to the clinician concerning the aetiology of the pleural fluid.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Bronchopleural fistula</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A bronchopleural fistula is a communication between the pleural space and the bronchial tree that persists for 24 hours or more. The most common cause is postoperative complication of pulmonary resections. Other aetiologies include lung necrosis complicating infection, persistent spontaneous pneumothorax, chemotherapy or radiotherapy for bronchogenic carcinoma and metastatic cancer to the lung, and tuberculosis.The presentation is characterised by sudden appearance of dyspnoea, hypotension, subcutaneous emphysema, cough, and purulent sputum, and shifting of the trachea and mediastinum. [35]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The diagnosis is established by placing a chest tube or small-bore catheter into a pneumothorax and demonstrating a persistent air leak.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Fibrosing lung disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically complain of slowly progressive dyspnoea. Crackles are present on auscultation of the chest. A prominent second heart sound may also be evident. The patient may have digital clubbing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A chest x-ray is often the initial radiological examination when fibrotic lung disease is suspected.CT scanning, however, is more sensitive and helps in determining whether there is an active inflammatory disease of the lung. A ground-glass infiltrate indicates that alveolitis is present.Further diagnostic studies and therapeutic interventions may be necessary.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Oesophageal perforation</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Oesophageal perforations most commonly occur after medical instrumentation or para-oesophageal surgery, and following sudden increase in intra-oesophageal pressure combined with negative intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or vomiting (Boerhaave's syndrome).Patients complain of severe retrosternal chest and upper abdominal pain. Odynophagia, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, cyanosis, fever, and shock develop rapidly thereafter. The physical examination is usually not helpful, particularly early in the course. Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitation) is an important diagnostic finding but is not very sensitive. A pleural effusion with or without a pneumothorax may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain chest radiography is almost always abnormal in oesophageal rupture. Early, the diagnosis is suggested by mediastinal or free peritoneal air. Later widening of the mediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pleural effusion with or without a pneumothorax may develop. CT scan may demonstrate oesophageal wall oedema and thickening, extra-oesophageal air, peri-oesophageal fluid with or without gas bubbles, mediastinal widening, and air and fluid in the pleural spaces and the retroperitoneum.The diagnosis can also be confirmed by water-soluble contrast oesophagram, which reveals the location and extent of extravasation of contrast material.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Giant bullae</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patient's complaints and physical examination may mimic those of a pneumothorax. Patient may also present with acute dyspnoea due to another cause such as an exacerbation of COPD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A giant bulla is defined as a bulla that occupies one third or more of the ipsilateral hemithorax and develops slowly over time. However, if there are no old x-rays available for comparison, then differentiation from a pneumothorax may be impossible. Faint radiopaque lines within the bulla may be the only clue that the abnormality seen on the chest x-ray is not a pneumothorax.Since placement of a chest tube into a giant bulla can have deleterious results, a CT scan of the chest should be obtained to help make the differentiation between both diagnoses.</p>",
