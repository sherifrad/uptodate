"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset of symptoms is typically sudden and associated with a traumatic event. Patients are unable to actively extend the knee and may be unable to bear weight. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays demonstrate irregular fracture line, usually without fragmentation of the tubercle (such as may be seen in cases of OSD). May be associated with physeal arrest of the tibial tubercle leading to recurvatum deformity. [4]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Maximal tenderness is at the anterior joint line, typically lateral to the patellar tendon, not at the tibial tubercle. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain x-rays are usually normal in Hoffa's disease, while knees with OSD may show fragmentation/enlargement at the tibial tubercle. [1]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Maximal tenderness is at the inferior pole of the patella, not at the tibial tubercle. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain x-rays will sometimes demonstrate a separated ossicle or elongation at the inferior pole of the patella, with normal appearance of the tibial tubercle, unlike in many cases of OSD. [1]  [4]</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A very rare entity.Patients may present with variable ability to bear weight, as well as pain, swelling, and localised tenderness over the anterior aspect of the patella (as opposed to the tenderness over the tibial tubercle in OSD).Patients may report a sensation of crack or pop with activities.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain x-rays may show a transverse fracture line, usually at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the patella. Callus formation may also be noted, indicating reparative process at the site of injury. Typical findings of enlarged or fragmented tibial tubercle are absent.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically present complaining of anterior or anteromedial knee pain, and intermittent knee swelling, sometimes accompanied by mechanical symptoms.A history of minor trauma may precede the onset of symptoms, or the condition may be completely atraumatic.Typically, tenderness is localised to the joint line (usually medial), with absence of tenderness at the tibial tubercle.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Classic location for OCD of the knee is the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The lesion may be visible on plain x-rays or may require MRI for diagnosis. [4]</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically may be difficult to differentiate from early OSD.Location of pain is similarly at or near patellar tendon insertion, although distinct tenderness to palpation over the tibial tubercle is usually absent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays are typically normal or demonstrate increased soft-tissue swelling in the infrapatellar region.MRI shows normal tibial tubercle and fluid accumulation in the infrapatellar region.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be difficult to distinguish from early OSD, and may occur as secondary pathology in knees with OSD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays are typically normal or demonstrate increased soft-tissue swelling in the infrapatellar region.MRI shows normal tibial tubercle and may demonstrate increased signal in the patellar tendon on T2-weighted images.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain x-rays demonstrate radiolucent lesion with areas of mottled radiodensity and ill-defined margins.CT or MRI is confirmatory.Bone biopsy performed by an experienced orthopaedic oncologist may be done to confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Laboratory markers such as ESR, C-reactive protein, and WBC count may be elevated.Positive blood cultures for inciting organism.The earliest changes seen on plain x-rays are soft-tissue swelling, peri-osteal thickening, and focal osteopenia.MRI is confirmatory.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with disorders of the hip may present with referred knee pain (via the posterior branch of the obturator nerve), typically on the medial aspect of the knee.They may sometimes be unable to bear weight on the affected extremity and have a limp.Physical examination of such patients often demonstrates limited range of motion of the ipsilateral hip, with a relatively normal range of motion of the knee.An episode of minor trauma may precede this presentation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays of the hip and pelvis, including anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral views, demonstrate abnormality of the hip joint.X-rays of the knee are usually normal.</p>",
