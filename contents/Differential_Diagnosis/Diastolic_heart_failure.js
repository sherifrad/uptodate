"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulmonary pressures may be indirectly measured by Doppler echocardiography. On echocardiogram, LV function is normal.The gold standard for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is right heart catheterisation.High-resolution CT scan may diagnose interstitial lung pathologies.CT angiography may diagnose pulmonary emboli up to the sub-segmental branch of the pulmonary arteries. Ventilation/perfusion scan may identify thromboembolic phenomena.Pulmonary function tests and sleep studies may diagnose obstructive and/or restrictive lung diseases that may lead to pulmonary hypertension.</p>",
