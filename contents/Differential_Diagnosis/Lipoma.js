"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The majority of liposarcomas present at a size &gt;5 cm, while most lipomas are &lt;5 cm in size.Often feel firmer to palpation than the soft, doughy feel of a lipoma.Liposarcomas can gain a very large size, either growing slowly over many years or rapidly over a short period of time. Lipomas are generally &lt;5cm in size and grow slowly or remain static in size.Retroperitoneal position would suggest a liposarcoma, since lipomas in this position are exceedingly rare.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging with MRI or CT may provide evidence that a lesion is a liposarcoma.Histological examination of biopsy sample: adipocytes with nuclear atypia to include hyperchromasia, size variation, and nuclear membrane irregularities. Lipoblasts (atypical adipocytes with cytoplasmic vacuoles which indent the nucleus), when present in the appropriate histologic background, are strongly indicative of liposarcoma.Liposarcomas are histologically subclassified into well-differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid, pleomorphic and mixed types, each with a unique morphologic pattern.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Subcutaneous epidermoid cysts are usually rounded and firm, whereas lipomas have a characteristic soft, doughy texture.Central punctum often visible, through which a white exudate can be expressed.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Definitive diagnosis is made upon excision and histological examination.Histologic examination: benign simple cysts lined by stratified squamous epithelium with an intact granular cell layer. Within the cyst lumen, there is characteristic laminated keratin debris. In cysts that have previously ruptured, a foreign-body giant cell reaction is often present.</p>",
