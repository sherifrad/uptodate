"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No specific signs or symptoms. Can be associated with difficult-to-control hypertension and abnormal volume status regulation.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Difficult to differentiate clinically.Although fibromuscular dysplasia places patients at a greater risk of renal artery dissection, spontaneous dissection of the renal artery or the aorta (involving the renal arteries) may cause severe HTN and loss of kidney function.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound, MR angiography, CT angiography, or conventional angiography will highlight an intimal flap.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with chronic kidney disease typically have difficult-to-control HTN and volume status, which may mimic RAS. Furthermore, diabetes and hypertension are both causes of chronic kidney disease as well as RAS.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> GFR is typically reduced.Urinalysis and sediment evaluation often show markers of kidney damage such as proteinuria or cells, casts, or crystals.Kidney biopsy may demonstrate glomerular, tubular, or interstitial pathology.</p>",
