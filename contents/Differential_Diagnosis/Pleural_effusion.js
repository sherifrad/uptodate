"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patient has a history of prior pleural disease such as TB or empyema, or exposure to environmental agents.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Thickened pleura from pleural fibrosis resulting from previous pleural inflammation, or prior environmental exposures such as asbestos, beryllium, and silica, can appear similar to a pleural effusion on CXR.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History to support a possible underlying cause, such as haemoptysis and weight loss in lung cancer.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Can occur in conjunction with the pleural effusion from compression or can be mistaken for a pleural effusion on CXR. CT scan or ultrasound can more clearly define the difference between lung collapse and effusion.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can result from paralysis of the phrenic nerve.Paradoxical chest movement during the respiratory cycle can be a clue to diagnosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A fluoroscopic test to analyse diaphragmatic movement with rapid breathing (often called a 'sniff test') can evaluate diaphragm paralysis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Extrapleural fat is asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The density of fat is much lower than that of fluid on CT scan and should be readily differentiated.Pleural tumours can also be easily demonstrated on CT.The presence of nodularity is often key to a malignant process. [17]</p>",
