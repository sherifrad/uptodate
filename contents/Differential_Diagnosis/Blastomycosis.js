"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute pulmonary blastomycosis is commonly mistaken for community-acquired pneumonia. Failure to respond to antibacterial therapy and extrapulmonary manifestations are clues to the aetiology.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Findings of blastomycosis on chest x-ray can be atypical for community-acquired pneumonia, and include mass-like or cavitary lesions or diffuse interstitial infiltrates. View imageView imageView image</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Histoplasmosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Histoplasmosis and blastomycosis share many of the same clinical manifestations, and the endemic areas overlap to a great extent.However, sputum in blastomycosis is generally purulent, in contrast to histoplasmosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Differentiation between these 2 diseases often relies on culture data. Histoplasma yeast are typically smaller, have narrow based budding, and are found intracellularly within macrophages in clinical specimens. There is some cross-reactivity with serological and antigen assays for these 2 organisms.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Coccidioidomycosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Coccidioidomycosis and blastomycosis share many of the same clinical manifestations. However, the endemic area of Coccidioides is the desert region of the south-western US.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serological testing for coccidioidomycosis is of higher sensitivity than for blastomycosis, and the yeast in pathological specimens appears as the characteristic spherule.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Paracoccidioidomycosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute/sub-acute paracoccidioidomycosis more often presents with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow dysfunction, while chronic paracoccidioidomycosis generally presents with dry cough and dyspnoea.Paracoccidioidomycosis is also endemic to Central and South America.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Paracoccidioides yeast are typically smaller than Blastomyces dermatitidis with thinner cell walls, and can be found in the mariner wheel formation, with multiple small budding yeast circumferentially surrounding the parent cell. [19]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Sporotrichosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The cutaneous lesions of sporotrichosis are similar in appearance to blastomycosis. However, lymphadenitis (generally nodular and subacute to chronic) is pathognomonic in sporotrichosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microbiological and pathological examination of skin biopsies will yield the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Tuberculosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cutaneous disease is less common in tuberculosis than in blastomycosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Acid fast smear and mycobacterial culture of clinical specimens generally lead to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Tuberculin skin testing and the in vitro interferon gamma release assays of sensitised lymphocytes are also helpful in diagnosis of tuberculosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Nocardiosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Nocardiosis and blastomycosis share many of the same clinical features. Nocardia is more common in immunocompromised people and has a worldwide distribution.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microbiological examination of clinical specimens in nocardiosis reveal thin, branching gram-positive bacilli that stain positively by the modified acid fast stain. Culture of Nocardia species is confirmatory of that diagnosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Malignancy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The pulmonary, cutaneous, osteoarticular, and CNS manifestations of blastomycosis can all be mistaken for primary or metastatic neoplasms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pathological examination of tissue specimens can confirm or rule out malignancy.</p>",
