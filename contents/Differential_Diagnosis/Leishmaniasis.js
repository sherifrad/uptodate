"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Formerly called tropical splenomegaly syndrome.The clinical presentation can mimic visceral leishmaniasis but fever is a less consistent feature. [62]  A clinical response to antimalarials also helps distinguish the diagnoses.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Major criteria for HMS diagnosis are splenomegaly greater than 10 cm on CT scan, high titres of antimalarial antibodies and IgM titres greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean of the local population.Plasmodium species in the peripheral blood smear is typically negative.The presence of high IgM titres helps in differentiating the disease from visceral leishmaniasis.In practice, visceral leishmaniasis must be ruled out by specific serological or parasitological tests. [62]HMS remains an exclusion diagnosis in remote endemic areas where IgM and antimalarial antibody titres cannot be measured.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> As the disease is more acute than visceral leishmaniasis, patients present with fever of shorter duration and mild or absent splenomegaly.Recurrent malaria can be more difficult to distinguish from visceral leishmaniasis, as fever can be longer lasting and intermittent, and the spleen markedly enlarged. [63]Unresponsive patients to effective antimalarials should be investigated for visceral leishmaniasis, as dual infection is common in endemic areas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Malaria can be diagnosed by microscopic examination of a stained thin and thick smear of peripheral blood or by a rapid diagnostic test detecting circulating antigens specific to P falciparum or other species. [63]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Splenomegaly, secondary to portal HTN, can be massive.Chronic schistosomiasis does not cause fever but patient may present with concomitant infection such as malaria, typhoid fever or TB. [64]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Chronic Schistosoma mansoni infection is diagnosed by the presence of characteristic eggs in the stools or by antibody-based assays.Abdominal ultrasound, CT scan or MRI show the typical features of hepatic schistosomiasis and the signs of portal HTN. [64]</p>",
