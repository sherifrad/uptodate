"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms: weakness and fatigue, bone pain, recurrent infections, confusion and altered mental status related to metabolic complications, and numbness and tingling related to neuropathy or compressive symptoms. These are vague and non-specific signs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> By definition, the diagnosis of MGUS requires the absence of anaemia, hypercalcaemia, renal failure, and lytic bone lesions related to the plasma-cell proliferative disorder.Serum monoclonal (M) -protein concentration &gt;30 g/L (3 g/dL) by definition indicates multiple myeloma or a related malignancy, but some of these patients have smoldering/asymptomatic myeloma and remain stable during long-term follow-up. [22]Only patients in whom these clinical findings of end-organ damage are felt to be clearly related to the plasma-cell disorder are considered to have multiple myeloma.Although the predictive value may not be high, higher concentrations of serum M proteins are associated with a greater likelihood of malignancy.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, weakness may be prominent. Features of the underlying cause (e.g., indications of infection or malignancy) may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nerve conduction studies and needle EMG help to confirm clinical diagnosis and determine whether the neuropathy is primarily axonal or demyelinating. If electrodiagnostic study reveals a demyelinating polyneuropathy, specific aetiologies should be considered.</p>",
