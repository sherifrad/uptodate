"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis of seborrhoeic keratosis. Sometimes differentiating between seborrhoeic keratosis and melanoma is a challenge. A key feature is that a melanoma tends to vary more in colour, such as brown, blue, black, grey, and red, whereas a seborrhoeic keratosis usually is limited to shades of brown and black.Melanoma usually has a smooth surface that can vary in height, while seborrhoeic keratosis usually looks the same across the whole surface. Melanoma does not generally have the warty, 'stuck-on' appearance of seborrhoeic keratosis. [1]  [2]  [3]  [13]Melanoma is less uniform and less symmetrical in colour and shape than seborrhoeic keratosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dermatoscopy: dark pigmentations forming an asymmetric ring around follicular openings, slate-grey dots and areas of irregular, broadened network. Also, biopsy and histopathological examination are used to differentiate.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More commonly located on hands and feet.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dermatoscopy: warts appear to be embedded in the skin, rather than 'pasted on', and are grey-brown or flesh-coloured, while seborrhoeic keratosis can be tan, brown, or black.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Arise on sun-exposed areas of light-skinned individuals, most frequently on the head and neck. [2]  [14]  Lesions commonly occur in older adults (fourth decade and older). Clinical characteristics vary with the histopathological subtypes. The most common type of basal cell carcinoma is the nodular basal cell carcinoma. Characteristic symptoms of nodular basal cell carcinoma are bleeding and crusting.The second most frequent subtype of basal cell carcinoma is the superficial basal cell carcinoma. Morpheaform/infiltrative/sclerosing basal cell carcinomas are more infrequent than the other subtypes but more aggressive and locally destructive. They have a depressed, whitish scar-like appearance. [2]  [14]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dermatoscopy, biopsy. Nodular basal cell carcinoma appears as well-circumscribed pearly pink or translucent papule with varying degree of pigmentation. Often well-demarcated telangiectatic vessels are seen on the surface.Superficial basal cell carcinoma appears as an erythematous scaly plaque or patch, most commonly found on the torso.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The Leser-Trelat sign is the appearance of a high number of seborrhoeic keratoses over a short time interval, especially on the torso. [3]  [5]  [15]  [16]  It is a paraneoplastic syndrome mostly associated with a GI tract adenocarcinoma (45% of cases). It is often associated with metastatic spread of the primary tumour and with a poor prognostic outcome of the affected patients. Approximately 100 cases of Leser-Trelat have been reported in the literature. The seborrhoeic keratosis may precede, follow, or develop concurrently with the beginning of the symptoms of the cancer. Involution of the seborrhoeic keratoses after successful treatment of the cancer has been described.",
