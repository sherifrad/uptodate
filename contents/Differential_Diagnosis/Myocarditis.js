"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There can be considerable overlap between dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. As many as 16% of patients presenting with acute dilated cardiomyopathy who undergo endomyocardial biopsy are found to have biopsy-confirmed myocarditis. [36]A family history of dilated cardiomyopathy, a known history of exposure to a direct cardiotoxin (e.g., ethanol), or the absence of elevations of markers of myocardial injury make myocarditis less likely.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The presence of an inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium with necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes not typical of the ischaemic damage associated with CAD is diagnostic for myocarditis. However, the lack of these findings does not exclude myocarditis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> It can be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish patients presenting with pericarditis from those with myocarditis based on history and physical examination alone.Both syndromes can exhibit typical or positional chest pain, and both are commonly preceded by a fever and/or a viral syndrome.The presence of signs or symptoms of heart failure suggests myocarditis as the aetiology, as isolated pericarditis does not impair left ventricular (LV) function.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Two-dimensional echo can be used to help differentiate these conditions. The presence of LV dysfunction (systolic or diastolic) implicates myocarditis as the aetiology.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy can present similarly to those with acute myocarditis.A history of an acute emotional or physical stressor within the prior 2 weeks with a rather rapid clinical deterioration supports a diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. [37]Rapid recovery back to baseline within 4 to 8 weeks is the rule for stress-induced cardiomyopathy, the occurrence of which supports its diagnosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No specific test will distinguish stress-induced cardiomyopathy from myocarditis.</p>",
