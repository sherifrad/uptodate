"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine pH &ge;6.3 on urinalysis with normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is indicative of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). However, dRTA can occur in MSK.Serum bicarbonate is the most sensitive and specific test for most forms of RTA. The finding of low serum bicarbonate concentration is the usual starting point for investigating metabolic acidosis.</p>",
