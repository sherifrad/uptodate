"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presents with sudden-onset severe unilateral scrotal pain.Should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all male patients presenting with acute scrotal pain, particularly when there is an absence of symptoms and signs relating to an infectious cause, such as urinary frequency, painful micturition, and urethral discharge.Occurs more frequently in adolescents, but can occur in all age groups.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Negative Prehn's sign: there is no pain relief when the affected hemiscrotum is elevated.Colour duplex ultrasonography has been shown to be useful in differentiating between torsion and inflammatory pathology in cases where the history and clinical findings are equivocal. [15]However, there should be no delay in performing scrotal exploration in cases where testicular torsion is considered a likely differential diagnosis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually a painless swelling of gradual onset, but can mimic an epididymitis in some malignant presentations. This is usually due to the presence of a superior polar tumour in the rete testis.",
