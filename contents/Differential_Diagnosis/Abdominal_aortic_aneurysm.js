"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Obstipation; abdominal pain is more common and typically localises to the left lower quadrant.No pulsatile abdominal mass on clinical examination. Instead, abdominal or perirectal 'fullness' may be appreciated. Fever is possible. [54]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool guaiac testing may be trace positive.Leukocytosis may be present.CT scan will demonstrate a normal-calibre aorta and possibly diverticula, inflammation of the pericolic fat or other tissues, bowel-wall thickness &gt;4 mm, or a peridiverticular abscess. [54]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Renal colic</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Severe abdominal pain that starts in the flank and radiates anteriorly to the groin.Associated with nausea, emesis, haematuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency or urgency. [55]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urinalysis positive for blood and may demonstrate crystals and/or evidence of infection.Ultrasound and CT scan will demonstrate a normal-calibre aorta and possibly ureteral or renal stones. [55]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Intermittent abdominal discomfort with flares lasting 2 to 4 days.Associated symptoms may include bloating, stool frequency, and abnormal defecation.Women aged 20 to 40 years are affected more often than men.On examination, most patients appear anxious, although general examination is usually normal. There may be poorly localised abdominal tenderness to palpation. [56]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging modalities are often inconclusive, but will demonstrate a normal-calibre aorta.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Inflammatory bowel disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Abdominal pain is often 'crampy' and left-sided. Patients typically suffer from diarrhoea (bloody and non-bloody), urgency of defecation, and tenesmus.Extra-intestinal manifestations are common in Crohn's disease.Abdominal examination may demonstrate abnormal bowel sounds, detection of an abdominal mass, and pain on palpation. Mucocutaneous lesions may be visible. Peri-anal fistulae, fissures, or abscesses may be present on rectal examination. [57]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anaemia is common.Radiographical imaging (i.e., ultrasound or CT scan) will demonstrate a normal-calibre aorta.Endoscopic evaluation with biopsy shows typical lesions of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. [57]</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is typically periumbilical with localisation to the right lower quadrant.Associated nausea, emesis, and anorexia are common.Patients are classically febrile with tenderness in the right lower quadrant or rebound tenderness on abdominal examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Leukocytosis and sterile pyuria on urinalysis is common.Imaging with ultrasound or CT scan will demonstrate a normal-calibre aorta with an inflamed appendix or evidence of perforation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Ovarian torsion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Women suffer sudden, continuous, non-specific pain in the lower abdomen; nausea and emesis are common. Patients may demonstrate fever on clinical examination and an adnexal mass may be palpable. [58]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Leukocytosis may be present. Ultrasound will demonstrate a normal calibre aorta and possible reduced or absence of adnexal vascular flow. [58]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>GI haemorrhage</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock may mimic aortic rupture. A history of previous GI bleed, haematemesis, melaena, or bright red blood per rectum is common.Historical risk factors for GI malignancy or peptic ulcer disease may be elicited.On rectal examination gross blood may be visible or coffee ground haematemesis may be returned with nasogastric tube placement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool is likely to be guaiac positive.Endoscopic evaluation may demonstrate the luminal bleeding source along with mucosal ulcerations, polyps, or tumour.Radiographical imaging with ultrasound or CT scan will demonstrate a normal calibre aorta.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Splanchnic artery aneurysms/acute occlusion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the splanchnic vessels results in a marked disparity between acute excruciating mid-abdominal pain and a paucity of early physical findings.Patients typically suffer unremitting, intense mid-abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting that might be accompanied by explosive diarrhoea.Most splanchnic artery aneurysms are asymptomatic until rupture. [59]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Leukocytosis, haemoconcentration, and systemic acidosis are common with acute splanchnic vessel occlusion. Elevated levels of serum amylase, inorganic phosphorous, creatinine phosphokinase, and alkaline phosphatase may accompany frank bowel infarction.Angiography is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic in the case of vascular occlusion.Ultrasound and CT scan will demonstrate a normal-calibre aorta and will diagnose any splanchnic artery aneurysms.
