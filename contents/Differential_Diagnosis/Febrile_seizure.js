"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Viral prodrome, vomiting, followed by profound impairment of consciousness and seizures.Toxins include aspirin (Reye's syndrome).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> LP may reveal elevated CSF pressure, increased cell count, and protein, with moderately decreased glucose.Bacterial cultures are negative.An elevated CSF/serum albumin ratio indicates an impaired blood-brain barrier and is the earliest sign of acute viral encephalopathy. [45]Liver enzymes and blood ammonia are elevated.Low blood glucose may be present.EEG abnormalities are variable but are of prognostic significance.MRI abnormalities may include bilateral thalamic necrosis, white matter lesions, and brain oedema. MRI may also be normal.Viral studies may be positive (e.g., influenza A).</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Childhood onset of multiple febrile seizures persisting beyond 5 years and associated with afebrile seizures.Seizures cease by mid-childhood (median age 11 years).An evolving composite of many syndromes, with shared genetic susceptibility. [46]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Genetic tests show links to chromosomes 2q24, 19q13 and 5q31, an autosomal-dominant inheritance with 50% penetrance.SCN1B, the gene encoding the sodium channel beta 1 subunit, was the first gene identified for GEFS+. [24]</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The diagnosis is made by history.Seizures are usually complex partial and are precipitated by bathing or pouring hot water (40-50&deg;C [104-122&deg;F]) over the head.Most common in India and Turkey.Not age-dependent, but males predominate 3:1. Only 7% have history of febrile seizures.Family history positive for epilepsy in 22%, and for HWE in 7%. [47]",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Afebrile infant, with an apnoeic attack, cyanosis, LOC, and short generalised episodes of jerking of extremities after a crying spell.The breath is held in expiration.Onset is 6 to 18 months of age, similar to that of febrile seizures.Some non-cyanotic, pallid breath-holding spells result from vagal stimulation after an unpleasant, unexpected stimulus.These are associated with cardiac asystole and are accompanied by syncope or anoxic seizure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> EEG is usually normal and the attacks do not predispose to epilepsy. [48]FBC and serum ferritin may uncover an associated iron deficiency anaemia, reported in 20% to 69% cases.Iron supplements are effective in prevention. [49]</p>",
