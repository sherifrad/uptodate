"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical historical clues to suggest this form of syncope include fainting with concomitant dehydration, antihypertensive medication or vasodilator use, and patients who are old and frail or have underlying conditions associated with autonomic failure. Symptoms that are reproduced with carotid sinus massage (CSM) are not consistent with orthostatic syncope.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Orthostatic BP measurement: a fall in BP (usually &gt;50 mmHg systolic), associated with symptoms of syncope or near syncope. The patient may exhibit the hypotension immediately after standing or it may evolve over the subsequent 3 to 5 minutes of upright quiet posture. Notably, this observation may not be reliably reproduced, especially in older people. Repeated or 24-hour ambulatory measurements may be necessary to elucidate this diagnosis.Tilt-table test: hypotension on standing.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Bradycardia as primary cause of syncope</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Syncope is possible with long sinoatrial nodal pauses or very slow heart rates.Occurs owing to bradycardia-induced cerebral hypoperfusion, especially in the setting of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.Common in patients with complete heart block and a very slow ventricular escape rhythm with LV dysfunction, and in patients with second-degree AV block.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG: may show sinus bradycardia with or without sinus arrhythmia, AV block with junctional or ventricular escape, His-Purkinje system disease, bradycardia, and AV block in a setting of myocardial infarction; deep T-wave inversions across the precordium indicative of a neurological event may occur in conjunction with sinus bradycardia.Electrophysiological (EP) testing: may be helpful in some cases, but the findings are usually non-specific. It may show quantitative measurement of sinus node, AV node, or His-Purkinje system dysfunction.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Bradycardia: AV conduction disorders as primary cause for syncope</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Paroxysmal or persistent AV block can cause severe bradycardia and thereby lead to syncope.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG: patient may have Mobitz type 2 second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, or alternating left and right bundle branch block; other observations that suggest an AV conduction disorder as the cause of syncope, but are at best considered to be only indirect evidence, include 1) bifascicular block (left bundle branch block, right bundle branch bock with left anterior or left posterior fascicular block), 2) Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block in older people (usually defined as &gt;70 years old).Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry: provides long-term ECG monitoring and thereby increases the chance of detecting ECG abnormality (i.e., AV block, possibly transient) if an arrhythmia is the cause of symptoms.Implantable loop recording: shows evidence of AV block.EP testing: in the absence of a direct symptom-arrhythmia correlation, a tentative diagnosis can be made in case of ventricular pauses &gt;3 seconds in duration when the patient is awake or if Mobitz type 2 second-degree or third-degree (i.e., complete or high-grade) AV block is discovered. In the setting of nothing more than bifascicular block or non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, invasive EP study may be helpful. On the other hand, these patients often also have underlying structural heart disease, so it is equally important to look for both the conduction abnormalities and susceptibility to tachyarrhythmias.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Supraventricular tachycardias as primary cause of syncope</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Very rapid heart rates; infrequently causes a sufficient period of prolonged hypotension to cause syncope; patients may complain of near syncope; reduced circulating volume status (i.e., relative dehydration), upright posture, presence of structural heart disease (especially with diminished ejection fraction or significant valvular or other outflow obstruction), and abnormal reflexes of the peripheral vasculature.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG: shows heart rate variability and microvolt T-wave alternans.Holter monitoring, loop recording, or EP studies: may demonstrate findings of supraventricular tachycardias.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually occurs in setting of ischaemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, or certain dilated cardiomyopathies that may result in symptomatic hypotension; similarly, VT in obstructive cardiomyopathies and arrhythmogenic right-ventricular dysplasia may cause syncope; torsade de pointes VT is a characteristic feature of the long-QT syndromes, arrhythmia may be very fast and often is self-terminating.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG: shows wide QRS complex (&ge;120 milliseconds), rate &gt;120 bpm lasting for &ge;3 beats, spontaneously resolving in &lt;30 seconds.Echocardiogram: shows compromised LV function, evidence of structural heart disease, or hypertrophic or idiopathic cardiomyopathy.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Non-sustained VT (NSVT) as primary cause of syncope</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> NSVT is a common finding during assessment of syncope (whether by Holter or extended-duration ambulatory ECG monitoring) but is diagnostically a much less specific finding than sustained VT.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG: shows wide QRS complex (&ge;120 milliseconds), rate &gt;120 bpm lasting for &ge;3 beats, spontaneously resolving in &lt;30 seconds.Echocardiogram: absence of structural cardiac disease.The isolated presence of NSVT, particularly in the absence of evident structural cardiac disease or ECG evidence of a channelopathy, should not be considered a causative diagnosis. However, if hypotension occurs with NSVT during EP study, or if monomorphic sustained VT is reproducibly inducible, a basis for syncope seems likely. [19]</p>",

Temporal lobe seizures are the form of epilepsy most often confused with syncope because they can either mimic or cause reflex bradycardia and hypotension.Metabolic and endocrine disturbances that can cause non-syncope T-LOC include diabetic coma, hypoglycaemia, and hypercapnia.",
