"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If a radiologist cannot differentiate on ultrasound, a nuclear renography scan or CT scan with intravenous contrast can rule out obstruction.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hydronephrosis is found in 43% to 100% of pregnant women and tends to progress throughout gestation; most patients are clinically asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If a patient is asymptomatic, no further testing is indicated.Renal ultrasonography is indicated if a patient has flank pain, pyelonephritis, or renal failure. Hydronephrosis beyond the level of the pelvic brim is a sign that obstruction from another cause may be present.Magnetic resonance urography is an emerging technique to evaluate the level of obstruction.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Perform urine pregnancy test in all females of reproductive age before imaging.CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis may demonstrate ovarian pathology.Transvaginal ultrasound is first-choice investigation if a gynaecological cause is more likely than renal colic: may demonstrate ovarian torsion.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive pregnancy test and gestation of about 6 weeks with ectopic pregnancy.Transvaginal ultrasound reveals ectopic pregnancy, dilatation of fallopian tube and free fluid if present.</p>",
