"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> An intractable epilepsy with seizure onset in the first year of life.Affected children have prolonged and repeated febrile and afebrile generalised or unilateral convulsive seizures, as well as interictal myoclonus and ataxia. Nocturnal generalised tonic-clonic seizures predominate.There is mild to severe intellectual disability, and variable motor abnormalities.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> EEG at onset may be normal. However, later in the course of the disease EEG is abnormal.Massive myoclonic jerks are associated with bursts of irregular spike and waves, or polyspike and waves, on the EEG.Interictal EEG may be normal in the first year of life, but gradually becomes abnormal with slowing of background.Sleep features are usually maintained.One third of the children show de novo mutations of the SCN1A gene.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A clinical entity characterised by focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation, occurring in clusters.Onset between 4 months and 8 months of age. Psychomotor development is normal, and seizures usually resolve within the first year of life.Mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant. [25]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The interictal EEG is normal. The ictal EEG shows diffuse discharge with onset in the central occipital region.Laboratory, radiological, and neurological findings are normal.A genetically heterogenous condition with loci mapped to chromosomes 16 and 19.</p>",
