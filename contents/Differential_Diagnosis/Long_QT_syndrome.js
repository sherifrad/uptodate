"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of CAD, MI, or valvular heart disease requiring surgical correction.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echocardiographic changes consistent with CAD, previous MI, and valvular heart disease. Echocardiography may show regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggestive of infarction and/or scarring. Valvular lesions such as regurgitant and/or stenotic valves in combination with left ventricular dysfunction may be identified by echocardiography.ECG changes consistent with previous MI characterised by presence of Q waves.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Triggers include cough, micturition, defecation, swallowing, upright posture, prolonged standing, heat, and hunger.Premonitory symptoms include sweating, feeling hot, and nausea.Recovery period: nausea and vomiting.BP measurement may show orthostatic hypotension, particularly when provoked during a tilt table test.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No differentiating signs or symptoms.History extremely similar to that of LQTS, with arrhythmias triggered by physical activity and emotional stress.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG is unremarkable at rest, with no significant prolongation of QT interval.Exercise test provokes PVCs with bidirectional ventricular tachyarrhythmias on ECG.Genetic testing shows mutations in the RyR2 gene in autosomal dominant inheritance and mutations in the CASQ2 gene in autosomal recessive inheritance.</p>",
