"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs and symptoms of anaemia per se may be identical to ACD. Evidence of bleeding, or a compelling cause for poor iron absorption, may be found in iron deficiency, whereas these are absent in ACD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ferritin is typically low (&lt;112 picomol/L (50 nanograms/mL)) in iron deficiency; normal or elevated (&gt;225 picomol/L (100 nanograms/mL)) in ACD. A ferritin level &lt;33 picomol/L (&lt;15 nanograms/mL) strongly suggests iron deficiency. The transferrin saturation is typically &lt;10% in iron deficiency; a value of &lt;5% makes iron deficiency very likely.TIBC is typically elevated in iron deficiency anaemia (&gt;70 micromol/L (400 micrograms/dL)) and reduced (&lt;45 micromol/L (250 micrograms/dL)) in ACD.Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is elevated in iron deficiency, normal in ACD. [7]  The ratio of sTfR (mg/L) to log ferritin (micrograms/L) is &gt;2 in iron deficiency.Bone marrow iron is absent in iron deficiency anaemia.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be no differentiating symptoms or signs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ferritin less helpful. Lowering the cutoff value from &lt;225 picomol/L (&lt;100 nanograms/mL) to &lt;100 picomol/L (&lt;45 nanograms/mL) increases the likelihood ratio of iron deficiency anaemia from 3.2 to 11.1. A ferritin of &lt;33 picomol/L (&lt;15 nanograms/mL) essentially rules in iron deficiency. [15]It is helpful to know that ferritin is approximately threefold elevated over baseline when inflammation is present. Thus, a ferritin of 100 picomol/L (45 nanograms/mL) in a patient with a recent known value of 33 picomol/L (15 nanograms/mL) would suggest co-existent ACD.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms and signs may be identical to ACD.Patient more likely to present with conditions related to chronic renal disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, polycystic kidney disease).Patients with end-stage renal disease, including those on dialysis, may have ACD in addition to anaemia of renal disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum creatinine is typically at least mildly elevated. Rarely, only the creatinine clearance is reduced, as in early diabetic chronic kidney disease.When ACD co-exists with anaemia of renal disease, ferritin (absent in iron deficiency) should be higher than otherwise, and CRP and ESR should be elevated.</p>",
