"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Faecal incontinence, hard stools, and blood per rectum suggest primary constipation as a possible cause for urinary symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Faecal markers (radio-opaque markers that are given on 3 consecutive days to evaluate constipation) and kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) x-ray, or ultrasound scan will demonstrate constipation.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Daytime voiding dysfunction primarily, as opposed to nocturnal symptoms. In spina bifida there is sacral deformity. Epilepsy is usually defined by occurrence of at least 2 unprovoked seizures and may be associated with incontinence.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tests depend on underlying condition, and diagnosis may be clinical. EEG may show typical abnormalities in epilepsy. Spina bifida may be shown by x-ray, CT, or MRI scan.</p>",
