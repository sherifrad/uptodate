"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions generally occur between the knuckles, whereas in dermatomyositis (DM) they tend to occur over bony prominences.Pruritus is usually absent. [66]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Autoantibodies: anti-Mi-2 positive in 25% of DM patients. Anti-Ro (SS-A) antibody positive in 60% to 70% of patients with SCLE. [66]Skin biopsy: histology of DM and SCLE are often indistinguishable. Immunofluorescent microscopy should be negative in DM and positive in SCLE, but positive microscopy is found in only 50% of SCLE cases and false positives may occur on sun-exposed DM skin.
