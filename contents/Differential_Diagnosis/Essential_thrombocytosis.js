"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> People with secondary or reactive thrombocytosis usually have a history of infection, splenectomy, malignancy, trauma, or surgery. The thrombocytosis is usually transient and subsides when the primary stimulus ceases. Despite the high platelet count, thrombotic and/or haemorrhagic complications are uncommon.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum ferritin &lt;45 picomol/L (20 nanogram/mL) suggests iron deficiency and may explain thrombocytosis.CRP &gt;95.2 nanomol/L (&gt;10 mg/L [&gt;1.0 mg/dL]) and &gt;428.6 nanomol/L (&gt;4.5 mg/dL [&gt;45 mg/L]) is seen in 76% and 52% of people, respectively, in reactive thrombocytosis. [15]ESR may also be raised.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with mixed cryoglobulinaemia may have a temperature-dependent increase in leukocyte and platelet counts when blood samples are tested at temperatures of &le;30&deg;C (86&deg;F). A doubling of the platelet count may be noted.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Repeat measurements done at room temperature may be normal.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Familial essential thrombocythaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is a rare disorder that is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern so there may be a family history.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Genetic testing for thrombopoietin and its receptor (c-Mpl) mutations can identify familial essential thrombocythaemia in patients.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> MDS is a group of disorders characterised by clonal chromosomal abnormality, ineffective and dysplastic haematopoiesis resulting in &ge;1 cytopenias, and a varying predilection to develop acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These disorders can arise primarily without any inciting event, but may be related to previous treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC in MDS shows normochromic or macrocytic RBCs and morphological abnormalities such as oval macrocytic RBCs and granulocytes with the pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly (hypogranular and hypolobulated granulocytes). Approximately 40% of patients have neutropenia and &gt;30% have thrombocytopenia.Bone marrow histopathology in MDS demonstrates dysplasia in a proportion of undifferentiated myeloblasts.Prussian blue iron staining of bone marrow aspirate can show ringed sideroblasts; these are abnormal erythroid precursor cells that have granules around the nucleus.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with primary polycythaemia (often called polycythaemia vera, polycythaemia rubra vera, or erythremia) may present with plethora, as excess RBCs are produced due to abnormality of the bone marrow. They may also present with thrombotic complications.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> In primary polycythaemia, there may be 8 to 9 million erythrocytes/mm^3 of blood (a normal range for adults is 4-6 million), and the haematocrit may be as high as 70% to 80%. The total blood volume sometimes increases to twice as much as normal.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presenting symptoms include anaemia, bone pain, and abdominal tenderness due to splenomegaly.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone marrow biopsy and histopathology show replacement of marrow by collagen (fibrosis).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presenting symptoms of CML and essential thrombocytosis can be exactly the same. Symptomatic patients with CML more commonly present with anaemia, easy bruising, low-grade fever, and susceptibility to infections. The most common physical examination finding in CML is splenomegaly, and the patient may complain of fullness in the left subcostal region.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Isolated thrombocytosis can be the initial clinical manifestation of CML. FBC shows that all patients with CML have elevated WBC count and half have a WBC count &gt;100,000/microlitre. A peripheral smear shows that most WBCs are neutrophils, but basophil and eosinophil counts are also commonly raised. About 45% of CML patients present with anaemia and 15% to 30% have thrombocytosis of &gt;600,000/microlitre.Cytogenetics testing: fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for bcr-abl gene transcripts provide the definitive diagnosis, with qRT-PCR being the most sensitive. The pathognomonic feature is the presence of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The end product is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph +).</p>",
