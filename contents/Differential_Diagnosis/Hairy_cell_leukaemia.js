"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically, CLL and HCL are indistinguishable.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Typically, the abnormal B cell in CLL stains positive for the antigen CD5, which is expressed rarely in HCL. The antigen CD103, which is expressed commonly in HCL, is not expressed in CLL. [21]  [27]  Typically, mantle cell lymphoma and HCL cells stain negative for CD23 antigen, which is found commonly on CLL cells. Over-expression of cyclin D1 owing to t(11;14) chromosome translocation is a hallmark of mantle cell lymphoma. However, weak expression of cyclin D1 can also be detected in HCL.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically, pro-lymphocytic leukaemia and HCL are indistinguishable.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pro-lymphocytic leukaemia is distinguished from HCL by a marked elevation of WBC count, as opposed to pancytopenia, together with the distinct morphology of pro-lymphocytes on histological examination. [21]  [28]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically and morphologically, HCL and SMZL/SLVL are indistinguishable.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> SMZL/SLVL cells do not display tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positivity and the bone marrow infiltrates are demarcated sharply. The immunophenotype profile displays negative staining for CD103, CD27, and CD25. [21]  [28]  CD11c is expressed commonly in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and HCL, although the intensity of expression is 30-fold greater in HCL than in B-CLL and SMZL/SLVL. [21]  Annexin A1 is negative in SMZL/SLVL, whereas it is positive in HCL.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically, aplastic anaemia and HCL are indistinguishable.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Practitioners should beware erroneous diagnosis of aplastic anaemia owing to dry-tap bone marrow aspirate with hypo-cellular bone marrow. Immunostaining for B-cell antigens is essential and can prompt more specific immunophenotyping for HCL. [1]</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The patients typically present with leukocytosis with an average WBC around 35,000 per microlitre. Splenomegaly is common.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Unlike in HCL, the absolute monocyte count is usually normal and cells lack several key antigens seen in HCL: CD25, Annexin A1, CD123, CD25; the cells are also TRAP-negative. HCL-v cells can be, however, positive for DVA.44 (CD72), CD11c, pan-B-cell antigens, CD103, FMC7, and express monotypic surface immunoglobulin. Patients with HCL-v typically do not respond as well to standard HCL treatment.</p>",
