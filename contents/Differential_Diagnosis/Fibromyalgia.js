"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Myalgia is localised, typically to an extremity and the attached truncal musculature.In contrast to the tender points of fibromyalgia, trigger points are the hallmark of MPS, with pressure over these areas not only reported as tender but causing radiation and reproduction of the pain.Some experts consider MPS to be a localised form of fibromyalgia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients with localised MPS do not have evidence of widespread central sensitisation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Vitamin D deficiency</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Low vitamin D levels are associated with widespread body pain. [21]  [22]  It is very difficult to differentiate from fibromyalgia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is low.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is considerable overlap between fibromyalgia and CFS, with most patients with fibromyalgia meeting criteria for CFS, and most CFS patients reporting widespread body pain. [23]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No differentiating tests.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> As with other rheumatological conditions, fibromyalgia may co-exist with RA, making the diagnosis challenging.Patients with RA will have not only widespread body pain and arthralgias, but should also have signs of active synovitis on physical examination.If a patient with RA also has positive tender points, fibromyalgia is likely. If the patient is treated for RA with subsequent resolution of synovitis and markers of inflammation, yet the patient still has widespread pain and fatigue, the most likely cause is fibromyalgia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> RF factor is usually positive.Markers of systemic inflammation (ESR, CRP) are typically elevated.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> SLE and fibromyalgia may co-exist.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Strict criteria for the diagnosis of SLE must be met; an isolated positive ANA test is not enough to establish the diagnosis of SLE in a patient with widespread pain as ANA is positive in up to 10% of the general population.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Osteoarthritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Joint swelling and inflammation are common in osteoarthritis, but not in fibromyalgia unless it is a concomitant diagnosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays are characteristic: joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, subchondral cysts.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Ankylosing spondylitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients have limited range of movement of the spine; spine movement in fibromyalgia is typically maintained.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-ray features are characteristic: erosions and osteitis at the ischial tuberosities, iliac crest, symphysis pubis, and femoral trochanter.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are typically older (&gt;55 years of age) on presentation than those with fibromyalgia.PMR is associated not only with hip and shoulder girdle pain, but also with significant weakness and stiffness, in contrast to fibromyalgia, where weakness, if present, is usually only of a mild degree due to deconditioning.PMR typically responds extremely well to corticosteroids, whereas patients with fibromyalgia will not improve with corticosteroid treatment.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ESR, CRP, or other markers of inflammation are usually elevated.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Hypothyroidism</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with hypothyroidism may have muscular aching and prominent fatigue that improves on replacement of thyroid hormone.A routine TSH test is recommended for patients presenting with suspicion of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism may co-exist.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> TSH is elevated and free T4 is low.</p>",
