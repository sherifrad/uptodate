"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with pneumonia often have a higher fever than patients with acute bronchitis, may appear more ill, and have rales on lung examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR will detect an infiltrate from pneumonia that will not be present in acute bronchitis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Allergic rhinitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with allergic rhinitis often have post-nasal drip causing a cough. On examination, acute rhinitis should be evident on nasal examination and from posterior pharyngeal drainage.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> None.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Asthma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with asthma have bilateral wheezing; the main difference between asthma and acute bronchitis is the chronicity of bronchospasm. In asthma, bronchospasm is recurrent and progressive.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> PFT may be useful between bouts of acute bronchitis to diagnose asthma in patients who have residual obstructive findings.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Pertussis infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cough has characteristic whoop in children with pertussis, although this is usually not present in adolescents and adults with the infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cultures, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), or direct fluorescent antibody testing for Bordetella pertussis will be positive.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>CHF</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with CHF may cough but also have other symptoms and signs such as dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnoea, rales on lung examination, peripheral oedema, raised jugular venous pressure, and a history of cardiac problems.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR shows pulmonary vascular congestion and may show cardiomegaly in CHF.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Reflux oesophagitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Aspiration from reflux oesophagitis may cause a non-productive cough that is usually chronic in nature. Burning and chest pain characteristic of reflux may be helpful in differentiating this from acute bronchitis. If wheezing is present, often it is only on the right, where aspiration is most common.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Upper GI endoscopy may show oesophageal inflammation or erosions with reflux. pH monitoring also can be helpful for detecting acid in the distal oesophagus.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Upper respiratory infection/common cold</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Viral upper respiratory infections and acute bronchitis may be indistinguishable. Indeed, many advocate calling acute bronchitis a 'chest cold' to denote that viral bronchitis is often simply an extension from an upper respiratory illness. The productive cough from a common cold can be from inflammation of the trachea or bronchial tree or can result from post-nasal drainage from an upper respiratory infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> None.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Medication/environmental exposures</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Several medication or environmental exposures can also cause an acute cough. These include the use of ACE inhibitors or occupational exposures to dusts or chemicals. In many of these cases, such as ACE inhibitor use, the cough is non-productive. In occupational exposures, generally symptoms are restricted to the cough without any other systemic symptoms such as fever, headaches, or lethargy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> None; the diagnosis should be made based on history of exposure to agents that can cause a cough.</p>",
