"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> UC typically presents with features of colitis including left-sided abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colonoscopy will show rectal involvement, continuous uniform involvement, loss of vascular marking, diffuse erythema, mucosal granularity, fistulas (rarely seen), and normal terminal ileum (or mild 'backwash' ileitis in pancolitis).Bowel biopsies will show mucin depletion, basal plasmacytosis, and diffuse mucosal atrophy.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically present with unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic diarrhoea, unexplained iron deficiency anaemia, or a skin rash consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is suggested by positive immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase serology.Duodenal endoscopy will show atrophy and scalloping of mucosal folds, nodularity, and mosaic pattern of mucosa; histology will show presence of intra-epithelial lymphocytes, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia.</p>",
