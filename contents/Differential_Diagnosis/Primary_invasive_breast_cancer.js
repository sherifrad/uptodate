"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Unlike breast cancer, fibrocystic changes are typically symmetrical and are associated with cyclical breast pain, which worsens in the luteal phase of menses. [70]Unlike the incidence of breast cancer, which increases with age, fibrocystic disease usually resolves at menopause.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound scan can differentiate cysts from solid lesions.If necessary, biopsy of the involved area will confirm the diagnosis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Like fibrocystic changes, fibroadenomas tend to worsen during periods of elevated oestrogen levels (such as pregnancy) and decline in size during menopause.Palpation of a fibroadenoma reveals a smooth, well-demarcated and mobile mass. [71]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound scans may be able to distinguish between a fibroadenoma (defined, oval contour) and a breast carcinoma (which may have ill-defined margins).Excision biopsy reveals fibroadenomas as well-delineated bosselated tumours, easily separated from surrounding breast tissue, and with a shiny and bulging surface on section.Histological analysis shows regular epithelial cells lining the duct-like structures, mixed with pale stroma.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mastitis tends to affect a specific population: lactating women or women who have had a recent breast surgery.Examination finds an erythaematous, tender, and swollen breast.Unlike inflammatory breast cancer, mastitis is also associated with systemic signs and symptoms of infection, such as high fevers, chills, and influenza-like symptoms.Treatment of the underlying infection leads to resolution of these signs and symptoms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging studies demonstrate no underlying mass.The clinical presentation and response to antimicrobial agents will usually sufficiently differentiate these conditions.Skin biopsy (if needed) will show no evidence of tumour cells within the dermal lymphatics.</p>",
