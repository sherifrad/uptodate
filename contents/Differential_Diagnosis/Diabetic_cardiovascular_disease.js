"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis can be made clinically, but several studies may assist if diagnosis is not clear.CXR may reveal cardiomegaly or pulmonary oedema.Serum brain natriuretic peptide is usually elevated.Echo provides information about left ventricular function, differentiates systolic from diastolic dysfunction, and identifies underlying valvular or structural heart disease.</p>",
