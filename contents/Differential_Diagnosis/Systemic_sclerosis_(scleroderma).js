"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tends to have milder symptoms.Attacks are symmetrical and precipitated by cold or emotional stress.There is an absence of digital ulcers.No history or physical signs suggestive of secondary cause.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> There are no diagnostic tests for primary Raynaud's phenomenon.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical and histopathological skin changes that are indistinguishable from systemic sclerosis.May be in a linear distribution (linear scleroderma).Most often seen in children and young adults, rather than older adults.There is a lack of Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, or visceral manifestations.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abnormal CXR, PFTs, barium swallow make the diagnosis of scleroderma more likely than localised scleroderma (morphea)Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Associated with over-exertion.Leads to adherence of skin to underlying fascia, usually sparing the hands and feet.Raynaud's phenomenon is absent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peripheral eosinophilia.CXR shows no evidence of interstitial lung disease.PFTs show no evidence of interstitial lung disease or pulmonary artery hypertension associated with scleroderma (PFTs indicate pulmonary hypertension if the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is disproportionately decreased in comparison with the FVC).Negative ANA.Deep biopsy, including the fascia, is important to make the diagnosis. It shows an inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by waxy, yellow-red papules on the head, neck, arms, and upper trunk, occurring over thickened and indurated skin.Associated with a diagnosis of amyloidosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Monoclonal spike on serum or urine protein electrophoresis.CXR shows no evidence of interstitial lung disease.PFTs show no evidence of interstitial lung disease or pulmonary artery hypertension associated with scleroderma (PFTs indicate pulmonary hypertension if the DLCO is disproportionately decreased in comparison with the FVC).</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR shows no evidence of interstitial lung disease.PFTs show no evidence of interstitial lung disease or pulmonary artery hypertension associated with scleroderma (PFTs indicate pulmonary hypertension if the DLCO is disproportionately decreased in comparison with the FVC).Negative ANA and anti-topoisomerase I antibody.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in patient with renal compromise, usually ESRD. Associated with gadolinium administration.Skin changes may be indistinguishable from scleroderma but Raynaud's phenomenon is usually absent.May have internal organ fibrosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR shows no evidence of interstitial lung disease.PFTs show no evidence of interstitial lung disease or pulmonary artery hypertension associated with scleroderma. PFTs indicate pulmonary hypertension if the DLCO is disproportionately decreased in comparison with the FVC.Negative ANA and anti-topoisomerase I antibody. Negative anti-RNA polymerase III antibody (there is no correlation with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and the presence of this auto-antibody).Skin biopsy has distinct pathological findings that distinguish it from scleroderma.</p>",
