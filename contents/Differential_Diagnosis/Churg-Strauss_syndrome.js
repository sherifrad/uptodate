"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC with differential will typically show no eosinophilia in Wegener's granulomatosis.Pulmonary function testing will typically be normal in Wegener's granulomatosis or may show evidence of extrathoracic airway obstruction in cases of subglottic stenosis. Alveolar haemorrhage and glomerulonephritis are relatively rare in Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) but common in Wegener's granulomatosis.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bronchoalveolar lavage with &gt;40% eosinophils is suggestive of eosinophilic pneumonia. Biopsy differentiates from Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Presence of vasculitis is seen in CSS in addition to presence of eosinophils. Chest x-ray shows a pattern termed a photographic negative picture of pulmonary oedema. Renal failure is more common with CSS.</p>",
