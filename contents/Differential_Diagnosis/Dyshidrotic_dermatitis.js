"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tinea may rarely present with vesicles.Patients with tinea often have prominent scale and may also have maceration, especially between the fourth and fifth toes, and thickened toenails (onychomycosis).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep will be positive, with fungal hyphae appreciated, in tinea.Consider sending a skin scraping for fungal culture if further confirmation is desired.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pustular palmoplantar psoriasis is characterised by pustules of the palms and soles, as opposed to the vesicles of dyshidrotic dermatitis.Classic lesions of psoriasis (thick, scaling plaques on the elbows and knees) are often present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy of dyshidrotic dermatitis will reveal spongiotic dermatitis.Psoriasis will have characteristic findings such as psoriasiform hyperplasia and Munro micro-abscesses.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History may reveal exacerbating factors in contact allergy. In addition, the lesions are more inflammatory than those of dyshidrotic dermatitis.Allergy to topical corticosteroids can be a particularly vexing problem because the dual competing effects of applying the medication in this situation are decreasing inflammation and propagating the allergic response.",
