"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A low-grade malignancy associated with neutropenia and splenomegaly, and 25% of patients have rheumatoid arthritis (RA). FS and RA are now considered to form an overlap syndrome. [15]Arthritis in LGL syndrome tends to be less aggressive than in FS, with fewer extra-articular RA manifestations. [8]LGL is more likely if onset of arthritis and neutropenia is simultaneous.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> RF may be negative.Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination show an expanded lymphocyte population with typical LGLs.Immunophenotyping shows an expanded population of lymphocytes expressing CD2, 3, 8, 16, and 57.T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies show clonal cytogenetic abnormalities.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lymphopenia is more common in SLE.Hand x-rays are unlikely to show erosive changes.High-titre ANA and double-stranded (ds) DNA suggest SLE.Urinalysis may show proteinuria and haematuria suggestive of SLE nephritis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with RA treated with anti-TNF agents may develop anti-TNF-induced lupus (ATIL), characterised by increased ANA positivity, development of dsDNA antibodies, and clinical features of drug-induced lupus such as fever, malaise, myalgia, and rash.Symptoms usually resolve on withdrawal of anti-TNF agent. [13]Splenomegaly is not usually a feature of ATIL. [13]",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR may reveal bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme may be raised.Hand x-rays are unlikely to show RA changes and erosions.Biopsy of lymph nodes, affected organs, or bone marrow may show non-caseating granulomas.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urinalysis may show proteinuria.Blood tests may show renal impairment.CXR may show heart failure.Ultrasound or CT scan abdomen may show hepatosplenomegaly.Serum amyloid P component scintigraphy may confirm diagnosis.Biopsy of rectum or affected organ stained with Congo red shows presence of amyloid.</p>",
