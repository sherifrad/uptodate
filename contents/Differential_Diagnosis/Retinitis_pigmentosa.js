"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Granular pigmentary changes on funduscopy. These tend to be more granular than the bone spicules seen in RP, but funduscopy alone cannot reliably distinguish the difference. Congenital deafness may also be present. Other features include microcephaly, mental retardation, microphthalmia, and congenital cataracts.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal electroretinogram (ERG).Positive blood test for rubella antibodies confirms infection.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Syphilis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pigmentary changes, evidence of retinal vasculitis (such as sheathed vessels), and placoid (plate-like) areas of chorioretinal inflammation. Other features include a firm painless chancre at the site of infection, skin rash, and general symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.In congenital syphilis there may be a rash, swollen liver, anaemia or jaundice, and rhinitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) will be positive.Serum rapid plasma regain test (RPR) will be positive.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sudden-onset, severe, unilateral but painless loss of vision. May have hx of amaurosis fugax.",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Posterior uveitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A greater degree of inflammation and signs of chronic inflammation such as posterior synechia, choroidal infiltrates in active phase, asymmetrical changes, and presence of vascular cuffing indicating vasculitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated WBC/CRP and ESR, non-specific markers of inflammation.Further tests depend on likely underlying cause: Lyme titer (can cause uveitis in endemic areas); PPD test (positive for patients with suspected tuberculosis); antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies positive in 90% of patients with Wegener granulomatosis).</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have hx of risk factors, including ocular trauma, previous detachment, or cataract surgery. Hx of sudden-onset central visual loss, possibly with preceding flashes of light. On examination there is subretinal fluid and cystic degeneration in an asymmetrical pattern.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Slit lamp examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy: retinal detachment; retinal break; vitreoretinal pathology (traction or presence of pigment).</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually a unilateral condition; patient may report floaters or conjunctivitis in the early stages with mild visual loss. More severe visual loss and central scotomas may be evident in later disease. On funduscopic examination crops of yellow creamy-appearing choroidal infiltrates can be seen in the active phase, caused by a nematode worm. Late changes are indistinguishable from RP.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Funduscopic examination is usually sufficient.Scanning laser ophthalmoscope: an infrared laser that is good for identifying live worms in young patients.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms depend on whether rods or cones are predominantly affected and are clinically indistinguishable from RP. On funduscopic examination there is retinal vascular atrophy but without pigmentary changes.",

"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Variable hx can be mild gradual loss of central vision or sudden severe visual loss with a vitreous haemorrhage. Foveoschisis (splitting of the retinal layers) can appear similar to cystoid macular oedema on funduscopy. Peripheral retinal schisis may also be seen.",
