"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with widespread scaly patches of the skin, especially on the extensor aspects of joints. May be involvement of the nails and arthritis.Patient has familial predisposition; condition may be aggravated by stress.There is no neural involvement, and skin nodules are not found.When skin plaques are scraped, pinpoint bleeding may be seen from the skin below (Auspitz's sign).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is usually based on the appearance of the skin. There are no special blood tests or diagnostic procedures but a skin biopsy, or scraping, may be needed to rule out other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis.Skin biopsy histology shows regenerative changes of the epithelium, absence of granulomas, and clubbed rete pegs if positive for psoriasis. No acid-fast-bacilli (AFB) are present on special stains.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Eczema</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Features widespread dryness of the skin and recurring skin rashes with redness, skin oedema, itching, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding.Areas of temporary skin discoloration may appear and are sometimes due to healed lesions, although scarring is rare.Likely to be found on the flexor aspect of joints. May be a history of allergy. There is no neural involvement, and skin nodules are not found.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy and histopathology show non-specific inflammation in acute, chronic, and healing phases of eczema, but granulomas are uncommon.Skin testing (patch testing) may be diagnostic in allergic eczema, and FBC may show peripheral eosinophilia. No acid-fast bacilli (AFB) are present on special stains of skin scrapings or skin biopsy.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Lichen planus</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with skin and oral lesions and, rarely, with oesophageal symptoms. Skin may show macules, papules, and rash. There is no neural involvement, and skin nodules are not found.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy and histopathology show hyperparakeratosis with thickening of the granular cell layer, a saw-tooth appearance of the rete pegs, degeneration of the basal cell layer, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the sub-epithelial layer of connective tissue. No acid-fast bacilli (AFB) are present on special stains.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Scars</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Burns and other injuries may leave behind anaesthetic scars. There is a history of trauma or burn. There is no neural involvement, and skin nodules are not found.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy and histopathology show an increase in collagen within the dermis without inflammation or granuloma formation. No acid-fast bacilli (AFB) are present on special stains.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Blastomycosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Blastomyces dermatitidis is endemic to North America and is a fungal organism present in soil. There may be a history of contact with infected dogs or cats.Presents with systemic symptoms of fever and with pneumonia. Skin lesions are widespread and ulcerated with typical pustules around the margin. There is no neural involvement, and skin nodules are not found.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Characteristic broad-based, budding fungal organisms in sputum or tissues by cytology or histology. Tissue biopsy of skin or other organs is negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Syphilis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Syphilitic skin lesions may often closely resemble the maculae of leprosy, but the absence of sensory changes and reaction to treatment are sufficiently distinctive.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The infectious organism is Treponema pallidum. Skin biopsy and histopathology may show inflammatory changes, depending on the stage at presentation. Secondary syphilis may be associated with granuloma formation, but no acid-fast bacilli (AFB) are present on special stains.The venereal disease research lab (VDRL) reaction alone cannot always be depended on in differential diagnosis, as false-positive reactions are not uncommon in lepromatous leprosy, in which case polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test may be more sensitive and specific.Examination of skin scrapings or skin biopsy with dark-field microscopy may visualise the spirochetes.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Yaws</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Skin lesions may often closely resemble the maculae of leprosy, but the absence of sensory changes and reaction to treatment are sufficiently distinctive.Largest group afflicted is children aged 6 to 10 years. Lesions are most commonly on the head, hands, and feet, with a history of previous cuts or abrasion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The infectious organism is Treponema pertenue. Disease is identified from positive serology. Examination of skin scrapings or a skin biopsy with dark-field microscopy may visualise the spirochetes.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Mycosis fungoides</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Early lesions might be mistaken for early nodular leprosy. Presents rarely earlier than 20 years of age and is most common after 50 years. Late-stage disease may have systemic involvement.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin involvement by cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Biopsy and histopathology are diagnostic, with infiltrates of neoplastic CD4 T cells that show clonality on T-cell gene re-arrangement studies.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Leukoderma (white patches or vitiligo)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Frequently associated with leprosy, but depigmentation in leukoderma is more complete and sensory changes are absent. May be associated with stress.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy and histopathology of depigmented skin lesions shows loss of melanocytes and loss of melanin from the epidermis. No granulomas or acid-fast bacilli (AFB) are present.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Lupus vulgaris</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Highly likely to be mistaken for leprosy lesions, and in both diseases acid-fast bacilli are difficult to demonstrate. Lupus produces painful, ulcerating skin lesions around the mouth, eyes, nose, and ears. There is a greater tendency to scar formation, and there are no sensory changes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy will show granulomatous inflammation with Mycobacterium tuberculosis acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on special stains. Distinction from leprosy is difficult, but in cutaneous tuberculosis there is often a proliferation reaction of the epidermis, areas of ulceration, absence of nerve destruction, marked increase in the reticulin, significant fibrosis, and, occasionally, caseous necrosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Cutaneous leishmaniasis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cutaneous leishmaniasis, and in South America, espundia, may be mistaken for leprosy. Lesions on the skin of the face tend to concentrate around the mouth and nose and form a more raised margin than those in leprosy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin scraping, skin biopsy, and histopathology. Demonstration of the Leishman-Donovan body will always settle the matter but leishmanial, lupus-like lesions on the ears may cause difficulty.</p>",
