"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Severe mental retardation; coarser facial appearance than NS, which increases with age; a high frequency of structural CNS abnormalities (especially hydrocephaly and ventriculomegaly); a higher likelihood of seizures than NS; and severe and long-lived GI dysmotility. [44]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Molecular genetic testing will identify different genes (BRAF, MEK1, MEK2).Although KRAS mutations may cause both cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome and NS, the mutations concerned are different. [44]</p>",
