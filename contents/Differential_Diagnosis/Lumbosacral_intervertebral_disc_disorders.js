"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Muscular asymmetry may be visualised, or there may be imbalance or obvious muscle spasm.Palpation of the back may reveal tender points, trigger points, or tight muscle.The straight-leg raise test is negative.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging or laboratory investigations are only performed if there is clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis, or when pain is ongoing for more than 4 weeks.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Lumbar facet syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Facet loading (a manoeuver including extension and side bending with rotation to either side) is often painful in facet syndrome but not in situations in which pain has a discogenic origin.Pain radiating across the buttocks and occasionally down the posterior thigh to the knee is suggestive of facet syndrome, whereas pain radiating down the leg beyond the knee is more suggestive of a herniated nucleus pulposus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Radiographical changes are non-specific for facet joint-mediated pain.The most specific diagnostic test is lumbar medial-branch nerve blockade (LMBB).There is more than 50% pain reduction post LMBB with lumbar facet syndrome.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Leg pain alleviated by sitting or by a flexed posture.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI of the lumbar spine reveals spinal stenosis; hypertrophy of the facet joints and/or ligament flavum with corresponding decrease in spinal canal diameter dimension.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mostly asymptomatic; back pain aggravated by extension.Exaggerated lordosis, heart-shaped buttock or midline step-off of the spinous processes may be present.Pain with single-leg hyperextension test. This test is performed by asking the patient to stand on one leg while simultaneously extending the lumbar spine. Pain occurs in the standing leg if spondylitic lesions are present on the same side. However, this is a non-specific test.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lumbosacral radiographs with AP, lateral and flexion-extension views (to assess for potential instability).Lumbosacral x-rays reveal linear lucency in the pars articularis.Also, x-ray of bilateral hips and pelvis may be considered to detect potential degenerative joint disease of the hips and/or sacrum, causing referral pain.MRI of the lumbosacral spine is typically confirmatory.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presenting mostly with back or neck pain at night but symptoms may reflect any radicular or myelopathic symptoms.May be no differentiating signs or symptoms.May be a history of neoplasm.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CBC, BUN, ESR, CRP, plain x-rays, CT scan, MRI and bone scan help to make the diagnosis.Biopsy of the spinal lesion will determine the histological tumour type.MRI with gadolinium may reveal enhancement within the bone or epidural space.Further evaluation may include bone scans to look for osseous metastases or PET scans to look for further disease.CT chest, abdomen and pelvis are ordered routinely to evaluate for a primary lesion.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain and associated spasms in the muscles of the back often manifesting as trigger points.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Infrared or liquid crystal thermography may be used to help diagnose this condition and may show increased blood flow associated with trigger points.Most other investigations are used to rule out other conditions.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Sacroiliac joint pain</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Focal pain over the joint.There may be a reproduction of pain with provocative manoeuvers, such as the Gaenslen's manoeuver.This manoeuver is performed by asking the patient to lie supine at the edge of the examination table, and to flex one hip ('bring knee to chest') while extending the other hip over the edge of the examination table ('hang your leg over the table'). Pain in either sacroiliac joint suggests pathology.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The most commonly used diagnostic test is guided intra-articular injection of small-volume local anaesthetic block. The validity of this test has not been confirmed.</p>",
