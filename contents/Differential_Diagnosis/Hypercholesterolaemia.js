"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Stigmata of liver disease, such as jaundice and abdominal tenderness, may be present.With significant elevations of bilirubin the patient may also complain of pruritus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin.Imaging studies such as abdominal ultrasound or CT scan and MRI may show dilated biliary ducts and possible cause for obstruction.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The hyperlipidaemic response is triggered at least in part by the reduction in plasma oncotic pressure, and the severity of the hyperlipidaemia is inversely and closely related to the fall in oncotic pressure.Spontaneous or drug-induced resolution of nephrotic syndrome reverses hyperlipidaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Marked elevations in plasma levels of cholesterol and, less predictably, triglycerides (TGs) and lipoprotein (a).HDL-cholesterol usually normal or reduced.Abnormal serum creatinine, urea, and serum albumin.Elevated 24-hour urinary protein.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Dyslipidaemia normally presents as hypertriglyceridaemia (due to diminished clearance).Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis are more likely to have an atherogenic lipid profile than those undergoing haemodialysis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> About half of patients have triglyceride (TG) levels &gt;2.7 mmol/L (&gt;200 mg/dL), about one third have total cholesterol levels &gt;6.2 mmol/L (&gt;240 mg/dL), and 10% to 45% have LDL-cholesterol levels &gt;3.4 mmol/L (&gt;130 mg/dL).TC concentration is sometimes normal or low, which may be in part due to malnutrition in this subset of patients.Abnormal serum creatinine, urea, and serum albumin.Elevated 24-hour urinary protein.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be lethargy, cold intolerance, constipation, dry hair or skin, goitre, or delayed return of deep tendon reflexes.In a study investigating people referred for the evaluation of hyperlipidaemia, hypothyroidism was found to be present in 4.2% of patients.A significant reduction in the serum cholesterol concentration during thyroid hormone replacement was only seen in those patients with a serum TSH concentration &gt;10 milliunits/L. [26]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum TSH is high and serum free thyroxine may be low.</p>",
