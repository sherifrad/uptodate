"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Blistering during early infancy may be similar to that of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), although usually the skin is not markedly fragile.The oral cavity is uninvolved.In older children, arm skin develops characteristic carpet-like thickening and scale, most pronounced within the antecubital fossae.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates intra-epidermal dysadhesion of keratinocytes.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Congenital porphyrias</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Some porphyrias may, like some types of EB, be associated with vesiculation or blistering of the skin with milia, although mechanical fragility is usually absent.In one type, erythropoietic protoporphyria, a stinging or burning sensation, particularly on the face, follows brief (i.e., minutes) exposure to sunlight.With time, cobblestone-like changes and scarring develop on the face.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Specific urinary porphyrin levels are elevated in patients who have a congenital form of porphyria.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Cutaneous absence of skin (aplasia cutis)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Infants with aplasia cutis, in the absence of EB, usually have wedge-shaped depressed skin areas on the scalp.Blisters and mechanical fragility are absent.In contrast, when aplasia cutis occurs in a patient with EB (Bart's syndrome), these lesions are usually on the feet, ankles, and wrists. [36]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No differentiating test is usually performed.A skin biopsy may be obtained to definitively confirm the diagnosis, but clinical findings alone are usually adequate.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Immunobullous diseases (e.g., pemphigoid, pemphigus, EB acquisita, linear IgA dermatosis)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rare in newborns and infants.Most lack clinically significant mechanical fragility or any of the other skin findings (milia, nail dystrophy, scarring) that are characteristic of inherited EB.Other family members are usually unaffected.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Direct immunofluorescence is positive in all immunobullous diseases, with patterns indicative of specific diseases.Bullous pemphigoid skin has IgG and C3 along the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ).Linear IgA dermatosis (chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood) has only IgA in linear array along the DEJ.EB acquisita has multiple immunoglobulins and C3 along the DEJ.Pemphigus has IgG and C3 in an intercellular pattern within the epidermis.Sera from these patients contain specific auto-antibodies having identical binding patterns on normal human skin or monkey oesophagus.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More commonly vesicular rather than bullous.Not associated with other skin findings typically seen in EB.The skin is not mechanically fragile.Maternal history may be positive for infection during pregnancy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tzanck preparation of the blister fluid demonstrates multi-nucleate giant cells.Characteristic cytopathic changes are seen in viral cultures incubated with blister fluid.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Uncommon in early infancy.Usually a very localised eruption.Tense blisters arise on reddened skin.Typical sites include the groin, trunk, and umbilicus.Ruptured lesions are covered with honey-coloured crusting.The skin is not mechanically fragile.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bacterial culture of blister fluid reveal Staphylococcus aureus.</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in infants and small children.Usually adjacent to a site of skin infection, such as the ear canal or nares.Erosions arise on reddened skin, most notably on the face and upper chest.Blisters are conspicuously absent.The surrounding skin appears scalded and the surface can be easily peeled away with gentle lateral traction.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy reveals superficial cleavage just beneath the level of the stratum corneum.S aureus can be cultured from the adjacent infected skin.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Localised tense blisters or vesicles arise on normal-appearing skin or on firm dermal plaques or nodules.Lesions may sometimes be induced by gentle stroking of the skin (Darier's sign).Milia are absent.The lesions are usually pruritic.Family history is negative.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy reveals dense collections of mast cells within the dermis, as well as within the blister cavity.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Very rarely these diseases may present with vesicles or blisters.Each of these, however, has other clinical findings that permit them to be distinguished from inherited EB.",

"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The non-bullous skin lesions in patients with 2 rare dystrophic EB subtypes (pretibial dystrophic EB [DEB]; DEB pruriginosa) may resemble those of lichen planus (violaceus papules or small plaques).Buccal white patches (Wickham striae) typical of lichen planus, not EB.Patients with lichen planus often have associated nail changes (pterygium).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy reveals distinctive routine histological features, including band-like (lichenoid) infiltrate of lymphocytes along the DEJ, enlargement of the granular layer within the epidermis, and saw-toothed epidermal hyperplasia.</p>",
