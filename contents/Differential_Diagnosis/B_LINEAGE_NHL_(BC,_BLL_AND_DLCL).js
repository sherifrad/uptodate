"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically indistinguishable from AML.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone marrow biopsy, peripheral blood smear, immunophenotyping, and immunochemistry may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis.Blast cells are positive for deoxynucleotidyl transferase and lack staining for myeloperoxidase; also demonstrate presence of lymphoid markers.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Palpable lymph nodes may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The expression of antigens representing both the myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia in the leukaemic clone suggests biphenotypic leukaemia. Cytogenetics may show Philadelphia chromosome t(9:22).</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of long-standing anaemia and transfusion dependence.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The distinction between high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML is artificial in that it is based on the numbers of blasts present. The estimation of blast counts can be difficult and is subjective. The blood film shows dysplasia in &gt;10% of cells of any lineage and the bone marrow may show up to 19% blasts.Micromegakaryocytes and acquired Pelger-Huet (spectacle eye nucleus) neutrophils are specific for MDS. Associated chromosomal deletions or unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities, particularly of chromosomes 8, 7, and 5, are common. Complex cytogenetic changes may occur.The presence of dysplasia may suggest that AML has evolved from MDS.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be a history of preceding chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The peripheral blood film may be indistinguishable from AML but may have an excess of basophils and eosinophils.The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9:22) (q34;q11) supports a diagnosis of CML but does not exclude Philadelphia chromosome-positive AML.Typically no other karyotypic abnormalities are present.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically splenomegaly is present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood film shows teardrop RBCs and a leukoerythroblastic film.Bone marrow biopsy shows reticulin fibrosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have history of medications that cause aplastic anaemia, such as chloramphenicol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood smear are helpful in differentiating diagnosis.Low percentage of blast cells in peripheral blood (&lt;10%). Precursors are morphologically normal.The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are hypocellular in aplastic anaemia.Patients should also be evaluated for an underlying paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and evidence of intravascular haemolysis (reticulocytosis, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin). A negative Coombs test is suggestive.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of using medications that may cause pancytopenia such as chloramphenicol, methotrexate, and chemotherapeutic agents.Cessation of the implicated agent or administration of an antidote such as folic acid for methotrexate reverses the pancytopenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood smear are helpful in differentiating diagnosis.Bone marrow will be hypocellular, and no excess of blasts are present.Megaloblastic erythropoiesis is seen with methotrexate.Bone marrow should be reassessed after holding medication.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Recent history of haematopoietic growth factor treatment may be present.Appropriate treatment (i.e., stopping the growth factor) results in normalisation of the blood count.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood smear are helpful in differentiating diagnosis.Bone marrow shows no excess of blasts but mature haematopoietic cells. Increased macrophage activity and toxic granulation of myeloid cell series may be present suggesting infections; Dohle bodies may also be seen in infections.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Macrocytic anaemia will be present unless there is an associated iron deficiency.Peripheral blood smear shows megaloblastic changes.Serum vitamin B12 levels are low.</p>",
