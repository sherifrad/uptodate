"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Due to infection by Bartonella henselae. Red papules or nodules that mimic KS may involve the skin, soft tissue, lymph nodes, and internal organs with or without associated HIV infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tissue biopsy shows lobules of capillaries with epithelioid endothelial cells, apoptotic neutrophils, and extracellular bacteria (silver stain). Lesional cells are negative for latent nuclear antigen-1 (LNA-1) of HHV-8 using immunohistochemistry. [15]  [16]  Microbiology studies for Bartonella micro-organisms may be helpful.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tissue biopsy shows a benign proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, many of which are reminiscent of histiocytes, together with varying amounts of collagen. Haemorrhage may be present. Lesional cells are negative for latent nuclear antigen-1 (LNA-1) of HHV-8 using immunohistochemistry. [15]  [16]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histopathology of the tissue biopsy shows a vascular tumour containing endothelial cells, which may be kaposiform in appearance, with prominent intracytoplasmic lumina.
