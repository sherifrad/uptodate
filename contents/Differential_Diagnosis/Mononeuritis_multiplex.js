"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients may not have been diagnosed with diabetes, and may present with weight loss.Patients have prominent lower extremity proximal pain, with asymmetrical lower extremity proximal weakness more than distal weakness.Weakness usually involves both thigh adductors and knee extensors.Sensory loss is not as prominent as motor weakness, but some evidence of distal length-dependent sensory loss is also present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrodiagnostic testing shows evidence of a lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy. Nerve root involvement can often be confirmed and is a typical and distinctive finding.Serum glucose may or may not be abnormal at presentation as patients often have lost weight as part of the prodrome and the course of the disorder. HgA1C may be elevated in these cases.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually presentation involves median neuropathy at the wrist (i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome), ulnar mononeuropathy at the elbow, and lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy (i.e., meralgia paraesthetica).Patients do not have symptoms or signs involving other organ systems to suggest systemic vasculitis.Bilateral median neuropathy at the wrist may occur without suspicion for mononeuritis multiplex (MNM).Bilateral, painful peroneal mononeuropathies or a unilateral sciatic neuropathy are likely to represent a vasculitic process.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrophysiological testing helps to show the severity of the entrapment mononeuropathies and the location of the entrapment, and suggests a diagnosis.There is often demyelination of the nerve at the site of entrapment, which is not consistent with a typical vasculitic MNM.

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with episodic, painless, recurrent mononeuropathies from minimal compression (e.g., after 20 minutes of kneeling, a peroneal mononeuropathy may develop with pronounced foot drop and sensory deficit in the dorsal foot and lateral calf).Patients do not have symptoms or signs involving other organ systems to suggest a systemic vasculitis.Affected nerves often recover within a few days or weeks, consistent with a demyelinating lesion of the nerve, differentiating from longer recovery periods associated with axonal neuropathy secondary to vasculitis or other causes.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrophysiological testing shows generalised, mildly prolonged distal motor latencies and typically conduction block at the site of entrapment mononeuropathy.Positive genetic testing for PMP22 deletion confirms the diagnosis. [1]</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents with numbness and paraesthesia within the territories of single nerves of the upper extremities, resulting in progressive weakness and atrophy.Patients do not have symptoms or signs involving other organ systems to suggest a systemic vasculitis.The chronic, slow progressive course and upper extremity involvement differentiate this disorder from a typical vasculitic MNM.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Electrodiagnostical testing shows motor and sensory conduction block in the affected nerves, often even if the deficits have been present for years.Peripheral nerve demyelination is not consistent with typical vasculitic MNM.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with pure motor findings, with muscle weakness, fasciculations, and decreased reflexes in the territory of the involved nerves.Weakness is asymmetrical and upper extremity weakness predominates, typically without pain.Patients do not have symptoms or signs involving other organ systems to suggest a systemic vasculitis.The lack of sensory findings and upper extremity predominance differentiates from a typical vasculitic MNM.",
