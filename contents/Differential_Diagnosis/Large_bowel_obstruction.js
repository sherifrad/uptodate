"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Impressive abdominal distension yet little or no abdominal tenderness.Around 49% of patients have underlying surgical disorder, 45% have precipitating medical disorder, and 6% of cases are idiopathic. [20]Typically seen in older patients who are admitted to hospital with a severe illness, for example, chest infection, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, renal failure, retroperitoneal malignancy, orthopaedic trauma, or electrolyte disturbances.Drug history may include neuroleptics, opioids, and laxatives.Concomitant conditions may include diabetes, myxoedema, scleroderma, Parkinson's disease, lupus, hyperparathyroidism, and recent metabolic illness.Recent trauma or orthopaedic surgery.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Gas in the rectum in the absence of a rectal examination is often present, and this has been demonstrated radiographically in right lateral decubitus and prone lateral views. [21]Contrast enema confirms diagnosis and excludes mechanical causes in almost all cases.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Long-standing history of constipation, diarrhoea, or incontinence.Visceral neuropathy. May also be part of an acquired visceral neuropathy (e.g., Chagas' disease).Drug history may include risperidone.Preceding viral infection.Recurrence after resection implies a misdiagnosed megacolon.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Difficult to differentiate; can be radiologically similar to sigmoid volvulus and respond rapidly to rectal tube decompression.Colonic transit studies and anorectal manometry assist in this difficult diagnosis. A slow colonic transit may be identified. Anorectal physiology excludes Hirschprung's disease where a normal recto-anal inhibitory reflex is identified.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presence of an initial colitis of any cause.Signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, tachycardia, hypotension, poor capillary refill) in early stages.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis may be apparent from clinical picture.Plain abdominal x-ray may show 'thumb printing' or intraluminal soft tissue mass (pseudopolyps).Cautious colonoscopy confirms the diagnosis not only by the typical mucosal appearance, but also by biopsy.Colonoscopy should be with minimal insufflation and rarely proceeds beyond the rectum and sigmoid once colitis is confirmed endoscopically, owing to the risk of perforation.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Previous history of endometriosis.History of pelvic pain.Colonic endometriosis causing obstruction is rare.Endometriosis has been termed the 'great mimicker'.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasonography (transabdominal and transvaginal) shows endometriotic cysts, but has a limited role in detecting endometrial implants.CT scan may identify cystic masses, but the features are frequently non-specific for diagnosing endometriosis.</p>",
