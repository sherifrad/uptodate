"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Associated with paraproteinaemias.Affects the hands, face, and extensor surfaces. RP and dilated capillaries at the nailbeds are absent. Skin dermis can break into solid papules. Due to the deposition in the skin there can be reduced range of motion of the involved areas.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Associated with diabetes mellitus. RP, nailbed dilated capillaries, skin tightness proximal to the fingers are absent. Typically both hands are affected. Limited joint mobility due to thickening of the skin and contracture of the fingers, which cannot fully extend or flatten. Rarely, larger joints are affected (generally in more advanced, long-standing diabetes).",
