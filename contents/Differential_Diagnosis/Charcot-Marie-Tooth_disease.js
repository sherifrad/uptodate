"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Causes include toxins, hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiencies, and renal failure.As with CMT, deep tendon reflexes are diffusely absent or reduced.Timeline of symptom onset and the past medical history help to differentiate this condition from CMT.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Investigations and results dependent on the underlying cause.Fasting plasma glucose: &ge;7 mmol/L (&ge;126 mg/dL) in diabetes mellitus.Oral glucose tolerance test: 2-hour post-glucose load &ge;11.1 mmol/L ( &ge;200 mg/dL) in diabetes mellitus.Urea and creatinine: may show chronic renal impairment.Liver function tests: deranged in hepatitis, toxin ingestion.Thyroid function tests: TSH elevated, free T4 and free T3 reduced in hypothyroidism.ESR and CRP: elevated in SLE, mononeuritis multiplex.Serum B12: reduced in vitamin B12 deficiency.</p>",
