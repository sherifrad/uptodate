"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Much rarer than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as a cause of infected ascitic fluid. It may be suspected if there is no history of liver disease or malignancy.Typically not the large-volume distention seen with ascites caused by liver disease or malignancy and therefore associated with SBP.Secondary peritonitis may cause more rigidity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Polymicrobial growth on ascitic fluid culture, which is particularly suggestive of secondary peritonitis if there is an anaerobic or fungal organism.Ascitic fluid is more likely to have increased protein and lactate dehydrogenase with reduced glucose. [56]Ascitic fluid is more likely to have increased carcinoembryonic antigen and alkaline phosphatase. [57]There is less likely to be a decreased absolute neutrophil count on repeat paracentesis.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be extra-abdominal signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (pleural, pulmonary, CNS, bony, genitourinary). Abdominal symptoms may be similar to those of SBP.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The definitive test is peritoneal biopsy with examination for granulomas.Acid-fast staining of ascitic fluid is not a good differentiator, because it is negative in up to 92% of patients with peritoneal tuberculosis. [59]CT scan may show enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.Adenosine deaminase level &gt;39 units/L is highly suggestive of peritoneal tuberculosis. [60]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs of haemorrhagic shock may be present. A history of a recent large-volume paracentesis may be a clue to haemorrhage. Abdominal pain and distention may be similar to SBP.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The presence of grossly bloody ascitic fluid on paracentesis, especially if prior paracentesis did not demonstrate haemorrhagic ascites, is suggestive of intraperitoneal haemorrhage.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be a history of previous pancreatitis. Abdominal symptoms and signs may be difficult to differentiate from SBP.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peritoneal fluid absolute neutrophil count likely to be normal.Amylase is typically elevated (&gt;1000 units/L), and the ratio of ascitic fluid amylase to serum amylase is approximately 6. [61]In a case series of 8 patients with pancreatic ascites, ascitic fluid amylase values ranged from 280 to 5730 units/L. [62]The serum albumin-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is usually &lt;11 g/L (&lt;1.1 g/dL), whereas in SBP (which typically occurs in the patient with portal hypertension), SAAG is &gt;11 g/L (&gt;1.1 g/dL).CT scan may demonstrate a pancreatic pseudocyst.</p>",
