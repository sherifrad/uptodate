"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There maybe a history of angina or cardiovascular disease, relief of symptoms with rest or nitrates and risk factors such as family history, smoking, DM, and hyperlipidaemia.The patient with ACS typically presents with central crushing chest pain lasting &gt;20 minutes, often associated with nausea, sweatiness, dyspnoea, and palpitations.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ECG shows ST segment elevation (in ACS with ST elevation) or depression (in ACS without ST elevation), tall or inverted T waves, or new left bundle branch block. Cardiac enzymes are raised.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Infective endocarditis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents with a new murmur, or change in the nature of an existing one, with fever, anaemia, splenomegaly or clubbing.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood cultures are positive in infective endocarditis.A CBC may show anaemia, raised neutrophils, and raised ESR or C-reactive protein.Echo shows vegetations if larger than 2 mm, giving a cause for a new murmur.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Mitral stenosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with dyspnoea, fatigue, palpitations, and chest pain.Distinguishing features are a malar flush, a low volume pulse, a tapping and undisplaced apex beat, loud S1 with an opening snap.The murmur is a rumbling mid-diastolic one, which can be distinguished from the Austin Flint murmur by the absence of the opening snap and loud S1.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: mitral stenosis may show pulmonary oedema, but other features include enlarged left atrium and mitral valve calcification.ECG: patients with mitral stenosis can present with atrial fibrillation. RVH may be present too.Echo is diagnostic for mitral stenosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Aortic stenosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presentation includes dyspnoea, dizziness, fainting, and congestive cardiac failure.Characteristic signs are a slow rising pulse, heaving but undisplaced apex beat, left ventricular heave, and an ejection systolic murmur that radiates toward the carotids and can have an ejection click.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: aortic stenosis may show LVH, but other features include a calcified aortic valve.ECG: aortic stenosis may show P mitrale, LVH with strain pattern, left bundle branch block, or complete AV block.Echo is diagnostic for aortic stenosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Aortic or pulmonic valve disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Aortic or pulmonic ejection clicks best heard to the right and left of the upper sternum, respectively. Click timing not affected by dynamic manoeuvres.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echo is diagnostic for bicuspid aortic valve and pulmonic valvular disease.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Atrial myxoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have symptoms of weight loss, fever, and malaise. Exam may reveal a diastolic tumour plop or diastolic murmur.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Heterogeneous masses may be sessile, typically in left atrium. Transoesophageal echo may yield more detail than transthoracic echo. Laboratory evaluation may reveal leukocytosis.</p>",
