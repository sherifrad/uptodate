"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Progressive muscular weakness and atrophy beginning in hands or feet.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Muscle biopsy may show rimmed vacuoles and tubulofilamentous inclusions in several types of distal myopathy (e.g., Welander's, Udd's, Markesbery-Griggs, Laing's, distal myopathy), but there is an absence of inflammation. [5]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Upper motor neuron signs (not present in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies).",
