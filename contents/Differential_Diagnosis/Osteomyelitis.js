"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of bone cancer, systemic symptoms (e.g., weight loss), a known primary lesion, and/or bone pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-rays of area of suspected infection would not demonstrate darkened areas typical of osteomyelitis. Conventional features of osteosarcoma are destruction of normal trabecular bone pattern, a mixture of radiodense and radiolucent areas, periosteal new bone formation, and formation of Codman's triangle (triangular elevation of periosteum). If no abnormalities are visible on plain radiographs, MRI of the entire length of involved bone is indicated. [63]  [64]Cultures examined through 1 or more commonly used methods of testing would confirm the absence of a bacterial pathogen. This determination is usually made pre-operatively; in some cases; however, a final diagnosis may only be made definitively through exploratory surgery.Bone biopsy may sometimes be indicated to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic disease by cytological analysis.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of fracture and absence of fever, erythema, and/or inflammation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Radiographical changes in non-infected traumatic bone are difficult to differentiate from infected bone because of distortion of bone architecture after fractures or multiple surgeries. [66]If plain radiographs are inconclusive, MRI will provide a more detailed image of bone inflammation and soft tissue damage than CT or radionuclide scanning. MRI cannot be performed in patients with metallic implants, limiting its usefulness in suspected post-traumatic infections.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Differentiating infection from aseptic loosening is difficult because both are similar at clinical and histopathological examination.Radiolucent areas in x-rays will indicate loosening of orthopaedic hardware that may result in pain, swelling, and other symptoms.Cultures will confirm whether an infection is present.Radionuclide scan at suspected infection site can be useful in ruling out infection, but is complicated by variations in prosthetics.</p>",
