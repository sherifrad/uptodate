"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Sudden onset of symptoms, such as cough, wheeze, or choking.Auscultation reveals differential air entry or wheeze.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Inspiratory and expiratory CXRs may reveal asymmetry of chest expansion, due to the ball-valve mechanism of the foreign body.Bronchoscopy is necessary for diagnosis and retrieval of the foreign body.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset in infancy. No associated atopy.Associated with maternal smoking.Diagnosis usually made retrospectively once the child has left the infantile age range.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Other features of cardiac failure are present (tachycardia, gallop rhythm, or hepatomegaly).Associated with congenital or acquired heart disease.",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Consolidation on CXR.Raised WBC count, procalcitonin level, and/or CRP in bacterial pneumonia (the last 2 tests are controversial: there are no studies on procalcitonin in asthma, while CRP can also be elevated in asthma). [38]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Infection with Bordetella pertussis causes prolonged coughing (also called the '100-day cough').Spasmodic coughing may lead to post-tussive emesis.Characteristic whoop may not be evident in younger children.",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sweat test: sweat chloride &ge;60 mmol/L on repeat samples is diagnostic (levels of 40 to 60 mmol/L should be considered indeterminate and suspicious).</p>",
