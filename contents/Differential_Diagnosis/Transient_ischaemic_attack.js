"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most commonly seen in a patient who takes hypoglycaemic medications.Can cause syncope, generalised weakness, or confusion, but also is reported to cause focal deficits, especially if old cerebral insults are present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood glucose &lt;3.33 mmol/L (&lt;60 mg/dL).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Seizure with Todd's paralysis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> One of the most frequent mimics of cerebral ischaemia.Patients will frequently have pre-existing epilepsy.Witnesses will report positive motor symptoms (such as tonic-clonic activity) prior to onset of weakness.Symptoms may have 'Jacksonian march' across the affected area.Incontinence, tongue biting, and post-event altered mental status suggest seizure rather than TIA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The distinction is frequently made based on the clinical history.EEG can be done to evaluate for seizures or for postictal slowing.Elevated prolactin level has a secondary role to suggest seizure.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Complex migraine</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually occurs in patients with prior history of migraine headaches.Aura or scotomata may precede onset of weakness.Presence of headache and nausea along with neurological symptoms suggest complex migraine.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis: no differentiating tests.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Space-occupying lesion (intracranial haemorrhage, abscess, or mass)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Preceding trauma or anticoagulation predisposes to haemorrhage.Fever or leukocytosis would suggest CNS infection rather than ischaemia.Headache and vomiting may occur with increased intracranial pressure.May have a relatively gradual onset compared with ischaemic neurological deficits.Rapid complete resolution of symptoms would be atypical of an irreversible structural lesion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Non-contrast head CT rules out presence of acute haemorrhage.CT with contrast or MRI can be done if continued suspicion for CNS abscess or mass.Elevated WBC count in an infection.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Conversion disorder/panic attack</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Deficits may not fit a single vascular territory.Physical examination may demonstrate inconsistencies such as demonstrating 'breakpoint' weakness.Prior history of psychiatric illness or major psychosocial stressor raises suspicion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis: no differentiating tests.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Labyrinthine disorders</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Benign positional vertigo may be mistaken for posterior circulation infarct.Hearing loss and tinnitus suggest Meniere's disease.Labyrinthitis can cause vertigo and disequilibrium but motor function and other cranial nerves should be normal.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis: no differentiating tests.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> New MS lesions or a pseudoexacerbation might be mistaken for TIA, but MS will tend to cause reversible neurological deficits lasting longer than those of TIA.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI can reveal MS plaques.Lumbar puncture in MS may demonstrate pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Peripheral neuropathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Bell's palsy may be mistaken for ischaemic insult. Unlike central ischaemia, Bell's palsy does not spare the forehead.Peripheral neuropathies with the exception of transient compression neuropathy tend to last longer than 24 hours.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> For peripheral neuropathy with transient symptoms, no testing is generally needed.</p>",

"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Syncope caused by basilar TIA is almost always associated with focal neurological signs/symptoms in addition to the syncope itself.Systemic illness is suspected based on fever, tachycardia, or hypotension.Hypotension may mimic TIA, particularly by causing pre-existing CNS injuries such as MS plaques or old strokes to have more pronounced symptoms.BP may be low or orthostatic vital signs may be positive in the patient with hypotension as cause of syncope/weakness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If underlying infection, may have an elevated WBC count.</p>",
