"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain located superiorly on testicle; onset is more gradual than in testicular torsion.Not associated with symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.Blue spot can be observed through the scrotal skin: the 'blue dot sign'.On physical examination, there may be a normal cremasteric reflex.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colour Doppler ultrasound will demonstrate increased blood flow.Urinalysis usually normal.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain located inferiorly and posterior to testicle.Pain and swelling typically develops over the course of a few days, unlike testicular torsion, which is usually of sudden onset.The epididymis can be felt as a tubular structure that lies posterior to the testis and runs in a sagittal plane.Diffuse enlargement of the testis will be present in epididymo-orchitis.Frequent and painful micturation are common features of lower urinary tract infection that can be associated with epididymitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colour Doppler ultrasound confirms the diagnosis: epididymis is enlarged and hyperaemic.Diagnosis by urethral swab and culture can detect associated STDs (e.g., positive culture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis).May have an abnormal urinalysis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Hydrocele</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> On physical examination the mass will trans-illuminate with light.The scrotal mass is likely to be soft if the communication is large or tense if it is small. It may be restricted to the scrotum or it may extend into the inguinal canal.There may be enlargement of scrotal mass following activity and variation in scrotal mass during the day.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Scrotal ultrasound confirms presence or absence of normal/abnormal testis.Trans-illumination when a focused beam of light is shone on the scrotum.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Varicocele</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Painless scrotal mass. Palpation of enlarged veins during Valsalva manoeuvre is diagnostic on physical examination.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Physical examination is diagnostic, but colour Doppler ultrasonography can be used for confirmation.Scrotal ultrasound with colour flow Doppler imaging will show presence of varicocele or identification of subclinical varicocele.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Testicular cancer</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be no pain.Mass has a gradual onset and may be an incidental finding on examination.Not usually associated with sudden-onset testicular pain unless possibly associated with epididymo-orchitis or intra-tumoural haemorrhage. [9]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound colour Doppler will show testicular mass.CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will show enlarged lymph nodes.Testicular tumour markers, such as beta-hCG and alpha-fetoprotein, may also be used to indicate tumour activity.Trans-inguinal biopsy for pathological confirmation. Extra-testicular tumours are usually benign; intra-testicular tumours are usually malignant. [16]  [9]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Scrotal haematoma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> On physical examination, there may be a normal lie of the affected scrotum and a normal cremasteric reflex on the affected side.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound may show an intra-testicular or extra-testicular mass. Acute haemorrhage would appear hyper-echoic. [9]  As haemorrhage ages, the ultrasound appearance would appear hypo-echoic or develop into a complex cyst. [9]  Ultrasound should not show vascular flow because haematomas lack vascularity.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Isolated orchitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Signs of inflammation (erythema, fever, and pain) may be present.Mostly caused by mumps or HIV.If sexually active, suspect STD.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound will show an enlarged testis with diffuse, focal, or multi-focal hypo-echoic lesions. [9]Increased blood flow on colour Doppler. [9]Urinalysis is not helpful in diagnosing isolated orchitis because the aetiology is usually of viral origin.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Scrotal abscess</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be fever and may detect fluctuant mass.",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Fournier's gangrene</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinically the patient will appear ill, and will possibly be septic.There may be fever and may detect necrotic tissue and crepitus.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound will show thickening of scrotal skin with a normal testicle. [9]  The pathognomonic ultrasound finding is multiple hyper-echoic foci within the scrotal skin indicating gas within the scrotal wall. [9]CT pelvis will show soft-tissue gas with possible fascial thickening and fat stranding. The aetiology of Fournier's gangrene may be identified: that is, peri-anal abscess or an incarcerated inguinal hernia.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Inguinal hernia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be a history of heavy lifting or previous surgery.May detect a mass in the inguinal canal that may be non-reducible. [18]Inguinoscrotal swelling with inability to palpate the spermatic cord superiorly.On physical examination, there may be a normal lie and a normal cremasteric reflex.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound will show abnormal ballooning of the anteroposterior diameter of the inguinal canal and, occasionally, a pad of fat or segment of the bowel is seen.CT of groin will show solid mass in the groin that follows the course of the spermatic cord.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Flank pain.On physical examination, there may be a normal lie and a normal cremasteric reflex.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound may reveal hydronephrosis or hydro-ureter on the affected side.Spiral CT of the abdomen/pelvis may show the location and size of the renal stone.Urinalysis will show microscopic haematuria.</p>",

"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Physical examination may reveal a palpable skin rash, colicky abdominal pain, or arthralgias.May also be scrotal tenderness and/or ecchymosis mimicking testicular torsion. [9]  The incidence of scrotal manifestations (e.g., painful swelling and ecchymosis) ranges from 2% to 38% of cases of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and about 3% of all cases of acute scrotum are caused by scrotal involvement of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. [9]History of prior upper respiratory tract infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urinalysis may show RBCs, proteinuria, or casts.Ultrasound of abdomen may show intussusception or perforation, or testicular swelling.Ultrasound of testicles may show testicular swelling.</p>",
