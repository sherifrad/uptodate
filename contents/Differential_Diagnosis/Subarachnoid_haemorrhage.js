"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There are no features in the history or on examination that differentiate this condition from aneurysmal SAH.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No aneurysms are found on angiography. CT usually reveals subarachnoid blood in front and around the pons (perimesencephalic or pontine cistern). Caution is required when this blood distribution pattern is seen, as it may also be seen with a ruptured aneurysm located in the posterior circulation. [43]  Overall, it has a better outcome than aneurysmal SAH.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is less severe and is frequently felt behind the eye or localised to anterior or posterior neck region. Dull neck pain might precede a more severe pain, occurring at the time of SAH. Examination findings might include a Horner&rsquo;s sign and/or neurological deficits related to stroke secondary to dissection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dissected arteries are visualised on cerebral angiography, MRA, or CTA. Axial T1 and T2 fat-suppressed neck MRI images might visualise the characteristic intramural haemorrhage associated with dissection.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms and signs are similar to aneurysmal SAH. Subarachnoid haemorrhage could be preceded or accompanied by findings related to mass effect caused by the AVM.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Arteriovenous malformations visualised on cerebral angiography, MRA, or CTA.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A subacute to chronic history of recurrent neurological deficits, with corresponding abnormalities on examination. Headache is usually less severe.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis may be present. Angiography might disclose beading of medium and small intracranial arteries. Brain and meningeal biopsy is, however, the diagnostic standard for this condition.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Saccular aneurysms of spinal arteries</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain localised to posterior neck/occipital area. Meningismus might be more prominent. A sciatica-like picture due to blood in the lumbar thecal sac can be seen.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Spinal angiography visualises the aneurysm(s).</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Age between 30 and 60 years. Cardiac, obstructive, or constitutional symptoms precede SAH.",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> On physical examination there may be a fever, heart murmur, skin petechiae, Osler's nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter haemorrhages under the nails, and Roth spots in optic fundi. Ischaemia may occur in the bowel and spleen.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Subarachnoid blood is usually focal, not widely distributed in cisterns, fissures, and sulci as in aneurysmal SAH. Blood cultures may be positive. Blood tests may show an elevated ESR and peripheral leukocytosis. Cerebral angiography reveals aneurysms located distally, typically in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Intracerebral haematomas are likely to be seen on CT. Echocardiography might reveal valvular vegetations.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients have a known history of pituitary adenoma. Visual loss is seen in up to half of patients with pituitary apoplexy (not a feature of aneurysmal SAH). Acute adrenal insufficiency develops in two-thirds of patients.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI with contrast shows pituitary haemorrhage or infarction. Subarachnoid blood is minimal and confined to the region around the pituitary gland.</p>",

"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is a history of drug abuse preceding the event. The headache is usually less severe.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine drug screen is positive for cocaine. Subarachnoid blood is usually minimal and focal in sulci. CT might also reveal intracerebral haematomas.</p>",

"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There is a history of anticoagulant use. The headache is less severe.",
