"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Longstanding epigastric pain, which does not generally radiate to the back; reflux; heartburn; and anorexia. Identifiable causes such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, Helicobacter pylori, Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> May improve with proton pump inhibitors, lifestyle modifications, and H pylori treatment.Normal lipase and amylase.Tonometry may show evidence of reflux.Laboratory evaluation will show normal values of amylase and lipase.Endoscopic evaluation will be diagnostic after visualising erosions, erythema, or ulcers, and allows biopsies to be performed.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Will present with acute abdomen, peritoneal signs, tachycardia, and sepsis. Generally the abdomen is rigid and tender in all 4 quadrants, with guarding.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal lipase. May have elevated amylase (usually less marked than that seen in acute pancreatitis).Plain x-rays show sub-diaphragmatic air.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of abdominal surgeries (especially colon resection, caesarean sections, and aortic procedures).Hernias in the physical examination.Presents with abdominal distension (depends on the level of obstruction), tympanism, decreased bowel sounds, anorexia, emesis (quality depends on location of obstruction), obstipation, or constipation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal lipase and amylase.Acute abdominal series will show ground glass appearance, air-fluid levels, distended bowel loops, absence of distal gas, pneumatosis.An abdomen/pelvic CT scan may be more diagnostic, and will show point of transition and potentially identify aetiology (such as volvulus, hernias, intussusception, masses).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cardiovascular risk factors: hyperlipidaemia, tobacco, diabetes mellitus, homocystinaemia.Acute tearing-like abdominal pain, pulsating abdominal mass, hypotension, and mottled lower extremities with decreased pulses and abdominal distension.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> High index of suspicion is necessary to make a rapid diagnosis and improve outcomes. In stable patients, where history and physical examination are equivocal, a CT angiography may be useful as a rapid way to make diagnosis.If too unstable for radiographic evaluation, patients usually go directly to surgery.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Charcot's triad (jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and fever) present in 70% of patients, altered mental status, and hypotension indicate biliary sepsis, usually caused by gram-negative bacteria.Patient may have a history of gallstones, peri-ampullary neoplasms, or biliary manipulation such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Several clinical findings are present more frequently in cholangitis, such as fever (95%), right upper quadrant pain (90%), and jaundice (80%).Normal lipase and amylase.Blood cultures are usually positive, especially during episodes of chills, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella as the most common micro-organisms isolated from infected bile.

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Severe right upper quadrant pain of sudden onset, jaundice, acholia, choluria, and hx of cholelithiasis. May occlude the common bile duct and cause pancreatitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal lipase and amylase.Ultrasound will show gallstones, stones within the common bile duct with extra-hepatic and/or intra-hepatic duct dilatation.Chemistry will show biochemical obstruction, with increased levels of total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-GT, and a slight increase in ALT/AST but normal levels of pancreatic enzymes (especially lipase).</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain is generally triggered after a fatty meal and localised in the right upper quadrant. More common in overweight females between 40 and 50 years of age.Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting may be present. May show a positive Murphy's sign and low-grade fever.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal lipase and amylase.A right upper quadrant ultrasound will show thickened gallbladder wall, stones with acoustic shadows, biliary sludge, peri-cholecystic fluid, and sonographic Murphy's sign, and allows evaluation of the duct system. Can suggest pancreatic head inflammation. May show mild leukocytosis and a very mild elevation of liver enzymes.A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan is diagnostic when there is no filling of the gallbladder or with delayed emptying of the radiotracer.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Normal lipase and amylase.Important to obtain serum electrolytes and an FBC.Hypokalaemia and alkalosis may be seen secondary to diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration.Stool examination for microscopy, culture, osmolality, ova, parasites, Clostridium difficile toxin, and white blood cells may help in identifying the causative factor.</p>",
