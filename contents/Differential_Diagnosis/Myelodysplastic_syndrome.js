"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have history of medications that cause aplastic anaemia; otherwise, symptoms may be the same.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of HIV infection or activities that increase the risk of contracting HIV.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> HIV testing is positive.Bone marrow may show some dysplastic cells, with erythroid and granulocytic precursors and megakaryocytes, but this is not usually a persistent finding and will change on repeat aspirate or biopsy.</p>",
