"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Caused by intrauterine loss of contact between the fetus' developing femoral head and acetabulum.May range from mild, asymptomatic cases to severe dysplasia with congenital hip dislocation.Moderate to severe dysplasia may predispose to early osteoarthritis, labral tear, or impingement and present with findings secondary to 1 or more of these conditions.Patients with congenital dislocation will have shortening of the involved leg and decreased hip range of motion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Shallow, more vertically oriented acetabulum seen on plain films.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Nerve entrapment</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rare cause of groin pain.Obturator neuropathy may result in exercise-induced groin pain, relieved by rest. There may be discernible adductor muscle weakness on motor examination if the patient's symptoms are present, and decreased sensation along the medial thigh.Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment or 'meralgia paraesthetica' typically causes a patch of numbness and/or burning pain along the anterolateral thigh. There is no associated motor weakness with this condition.Ilio-inguinal nerve compression may cause pain in the groin or genital region. It is most commonly seen in patients with a history of prior abdominal surgery or hypertrophic abdominal muscles.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis of obturator nerve entrapment can be confirmed by EMG that shows chronic denervation changes along the affected muscle group.Diagnosis of lateral femoral cutaneous or ilio-inguinal nerve entrapment may be made by local infiltration of lidocaine anaesthetic, which should relieve symptoms within minutes.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Spondyloarthropathy typically seen in young to middle-aged men.Hip joint involvement is common, often bilateral.Symptoms (stiffness, pain) are worse in the morning and improve during the course of the day.Low back and sacro-iliac joints are also frequently affected.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain film x-rays of the hip and pelvis may demonstrate irregularities of the sacro-iliac joints with possible erosive and sclerotic changes.The lumbar spine may reveal bridging syndesmophytes of multiple vertebrae leading to the classic 'bamboo spine' appearance.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Rheumatoid arthritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Systemic inflammatory disease with multiple joint involvement.While classically associated with small joints of the hands and feet, hip joint involvement is commonly seen as well.Monoarticular involvement of the hip joint as a presenting symptom in an undiagnosed rheumatoid patient, while rare, can be mistaken for septic arthritis due to the marked inflammatory process and joint synovitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain film x-rays may demonstrate varying degrees of concentric joint space narrowing, cysts, and periarticular erosions. Unlike in osteoarthritis, osteophytes and sclerotic changes are not typically present.Definitive serological tests, such as rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), are positive in around 70% of patients.

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Osteoarthritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically seen in patients aged &gt;50 years. Presents with activity-related pain; in advanced cases there may be a component of rest or night pain. Limited range of motion with pain at the extremes (especially flexion and internal rotation). Hip flexion contracture may be present. Positive Stinchfield and/or Trendelenburg sign.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain film radiographs with anteroposterior (AP) pelvis, AP and lateral hip, or frog's leg view may demonstrate joint space narrowing, sclerotic and/or cystic changes, and osteophyte formation.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Osteonecrosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of recent trauma (femoral neck fracture, hip dislocation) or presence of risk factors (excessive alcohol consumption, chronic corticosteroid use). Bilateral in up to 50% of cases.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain film radiographs may be unremarkable in early stage of disease. Later stages characterised by subchondral collapse with formation of a 'crescent sign'.MRI is the definitive test in these circumstances and may demonstrate bony oedema, revascularisation changes seen early in the disease process.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Lumbar disc pathology</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rare cause of groin pain. Upper lumbar disc herniation (L1 or L2) may cause referred pain to groin area.Pain typically worse with Valsalva manoeuvres (e.g., sneezing or bearing down). Back and buttock pain may be present.Hip examination is unremarkable. Motor examination may demonstrate hip flexor weakness. Sensation may be subjectively decreased along dermatomal distribution.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain film x-rays of lumbar spine may demonstrate degenerative disc disease of upper lumbar vertebrae.MRI of the lumbar spine should be obtained to rule out disc herniation or foraminal narrowing impinging on corresponding lumbar nerve root.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Septic arthritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute presentation. Joint is usually hot, swollen, and tender, with restricted movement, severe pain on weight-bearing. Fever may be present. More common in joints with a prosthesis. Resting position of hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation may be adopted to relieve pain.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC with differential shows raised WBC count. Blood cultures may be positive. ESR and C-reactive protein elevated. Synovial fluid Gram stain and WBC count positive.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Osteomyelitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically a chronic or acute-on-chronic presentation, with vague pain complaints. May have rest or night pain. Constitutional symptoms (fevers, chills, malaise) often present. An unremarkable hip examination possible if the infectious process involves the pelvis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC with differential may show elevated WBC count. Blood cultures may be positive. ESR and C-reactive protein may be elevated.Plain film radiographs may show changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis in some cases. MRI has higher sensitivity and specificity: up to 98% and 89%, respectively. [16]</p>",
