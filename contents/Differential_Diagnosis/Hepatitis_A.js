"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive by ELISA and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) or positive HCV RNA.Anti-HCV may be negative in acute HCV infection; thus, patient is tested for HCV RNA if anti-HCV is negative, the patient has HCV-associated risk factors, and acute HCV infection is suspected.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ESR elevated.Serum electrophoresis and serum autoantibodies: patients may have serum gamma-globulin concentrations more than twice normal, and sometimes antinuclear antibodies and/or anti-smooth muscle (anti-actin) antibodies. Patients with another subtype may have normal or only slightly elevated serum gamma-globulin concentrations, but will have antibodies against a particular cytochrome p450 isoenzyme that are called anti-LKM (liver kidney microsome).Liver biopsy is characterised by a periportal lesion or interface hepatitis (a portal mononuclear and plasma cell infiltrate).</p>",
