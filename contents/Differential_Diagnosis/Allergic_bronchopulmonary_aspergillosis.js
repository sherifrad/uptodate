"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Similar clinical features to ABPA.Asthma accompanies or precedes the illness in 50% of cases. [33]Occurs predominantly in women and non-smokers; cases have been reported after radiotherapy for breast cancer. [34]  [43]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: bilateral peripheral or pleural-based infiltrates, described as the photographic negative of pulmonary oedema, are virtually pathognomonic for chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP).Lung biopsy: CEP is characterised by interstitial and alveolar eosinophils and histiocytes. Fibrosis is minimal, and bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia is a commonly associated finding. [33]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vasculitic disorder as opposed to an allergic condition.Often includes sinusitis as a clinical manifestation, whereas sinusitis rarely occurs with ABPA. [44]  [45]  [46]The skin and cardiovascular, GI, and nervous systems may also be involved. Skin symptoms include palpable purpura, petechiae, or granulomatous nodules. Cardiovascular symptoms include pericarditis, heart failure, and myocardial infarct. GI symptoms include diarrhoea, pain, bleeding, and colitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: commonly shows transient and patchy opacities without lobar or segmental distribution. [46]Lung biopsy: eosinophilic infiltrates, an eosinophilic vasculitis (especially of the small arteries and veins), interstitial and perivascular necrotising granulomas, and areas of necrosis. [45]  [46]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> HES are associated with marked peripheral eosinophilia and potential involvement of diverse organs such as the heart, GI tract, lungs, brain, and skin. [47]Although 40% of HES patients have pulmonary manifestations, they also have signs and/or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (not limited to the respiratory tract). Cardiac manifestations of eosinophilic myocarditis are the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Neurological manifestations of cerebral thromboemboli, encephalopathy, and neuropathy may be presenting symptoms. Colitis and gastritis may occur from eosinophil infiltration of gut mucosa. Common skin manifestations are eczema, hives, and angio-oedema.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Molecular testing for the FIP1L1/PDGFR-alpha mutation: may be positive for a genetic variant of HES. [48]Bone marrow evaluation: demonstrates increased eosinophils and eosinophil precursors or may confirm a myeloproliferative process. [47]Blood eosinophilia: HES has &ge;1.50 x 10^9/L ( &ge;1500/microlitre) present on at least 2 occasions in the absence of any other cause. In ABPA the cause is hypersensitivity to the Aspergillus mould, whereas in HES no aetiology is found.</p>",
