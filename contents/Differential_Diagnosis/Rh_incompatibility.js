"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hydrops fetalis consists of generalised subcutaneous oedema and fluid collections in some or all serous cavities.Placental calcification, oligohydramnios, and intrauterine growth restrictions may be associated with congenital infections. [23]  [22]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Maternal serum antibodies are negative in non-immune fetal hydrops. There are more than 80 causes of fetal hydrops.Non-immune hydrops carries a high rate of infant mortality, and in many cases (17%) its cause remains indeterminate after diagnostic work-up. [21]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Parvovirus infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hx of environmental exposure to parvovirus may arouse suspicion of possible infection in asymptomatic people.Symptoms include maternal fever, myalgia, coryza, headache, nausea, and erythematous, maculopapular exanthema on the trunk and limbs. Arthropathy and arthritis are also common in women and adolescents.Progressive fetal anaemia, due to preferential destruction of immature erythrocytes by the virus, leads to hydrops and intrauterine fetal death. [17]  [24]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Viral-specific IgM appears about 10 to 12 days after infection. Fetal infection is confirmed by analysing amniotic fluid, cord blood, or serous fluid for viral DNA or RNA by PCR. [24]When severe fetal anaemia or hydrops is diagnosed, intrauterine fetal transfusion is recommended. In early gestational age (&lt;20 weeks) disease, intraperitoneal transfusion is recommended.

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Non-RhD haemolytic disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually transfusion induced. The mechanism for fetal anaemia is haemolysis and erythroid suppression.Prior obstetrical hx does not reliably predict occurrence in subsequent pregnancy, and maternal antibody titre does not correlate with severity. [3]Kell's alloimmunisation is the most common non-RhD haemolytic disease, with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.2% in the obstetric population.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum antibodies can be detected in the maternal blood. Although the titre is not as reliable as in RhD disease, severe disease is unusual with titres &lt;1:32, with the exception of anti-Kell's antibodies where significant fetal disease can occur at much lower titres.Middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler should be performed and has been shown to be reliable for fetal anaemia detection.Fetal haemoglobin should be assessed by cordocentesis when non-invasive testing (MCA Doppler) is abnormal.

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be present in up to 1% of pregnancies.Large placental masses of 5 cm or greater may produce complications such as fetal anaemia, hydrops, and polyhydramnios, and poor perinatal outcome. [17]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A solid placental mass is detected by standard 2-dimensional sonography, and colour Doppler sonography reveals a pulsatile mass.Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein may be high in association with a placental chorioangioma. Doppler velocimetry of the MCA may be consistent with fetal anaemia. [25]</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Severe, acute fetomaternal haemorrhage may be entirely asymptomatic or manifest as a reduction in perceived fetal movements by the mother. Clinical symptoms are usually non-specific.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peak systolic velocity on MCA Doppler may be increased.Kleihauer-Betke's test (persistence of fetal RBCs in maternal serum after denaturation by strong acid) or flow cytometry is also helpful. [17]</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Develops in association with monochorionic twin placentation, usually between 15 and 26 weeks' gestation. It is found in 5.5% to 17.5% of all monochorionic pregnancies.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound findings include polyhydramnios in one twin (recipient), and amniotic sac and oligohydramnios in the other (donor).Growth of fetuses is usually discordant. [26]Hydrops may develop in later stages of the disease, usually in the recipient co-twin.Perinatal mortality may reach 80% to 100% when untreated. [26]</p>",
