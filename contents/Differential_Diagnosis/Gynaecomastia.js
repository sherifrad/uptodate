"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Risk of both gynaecomastia and breast cancer increased in high oestrogen states.Men with family history of the BRCA2 gene mutation, prostate cancer, or Klinefelter's syndrome at higher risk.Malignancy should be considered if the breast mass is unilateral, although gynaecomastia can be unilateral and breast cancer bilateral.Breast cancer is usually painless, but not always. The mass may be eccentric (10% to 30%) rather than sub-areolar. The mass often is irregular, rather than smooth; rubbery or hard rather than firm; and fixed rather than mobile.Any overlying nipple deformity or ulceration or discharge; red, thickened, or ulcerated overlying skin; or axillary adenopathy raises suspicion for malignancy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Any eccentric, irregular, hard, or fixed mass, or associated nipple or skin abnormality, or axillary adenopathy, mandates a biopsy.A core biopsy is preferred. [34] View imageMammography is 90% specific and 90% sensitive for a malignant mass in men. [35]</p>",
