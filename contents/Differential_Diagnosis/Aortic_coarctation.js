"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presenting features vary depending on the severity of stenosis. With mild AS, the patient may be asymptomatic with a harsh systolic ejection quality murmur at the upper right sternal border with radiation to the carotids on physical examination. In moderate or severe AS, the patient may have significant SOB, especially on exertion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Differentiated from coarctation of the aorta by echocardiogram.Two-dimensional echocardiogram of the aortic valve shows an abnormally narrowed or dysplastic aortic valve.Colour Doppler and pulse Doppler across the aortic valve show turbulent blood flow across the valve and are used to measure the gradient.Patients with aortic coarctation with associated bicuspid aortic valve may also have AS.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents as shock in neonates. Unable to clinically differentiate between interruption of the aortic arch and critical coarctation of the aorta.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echocardiogram will differentiate the severe narrowing seen in critical coarctation from a frank interruption.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Depending on the level and severity of the obstruction, patients may be asymptomatic or may present with SOB, especially on exertion.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An echocardiogram will differentiate the level of the obstructed or narrowed area in the aorta. Using colour and pulse Doppler, any narrowing in the left ventricular outflow tract can be localised to the valvar, sub-valvar, or supra-valvar area, or across the aortic arch.</p>",
