"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fluctuating hearing loss, low-pitch tinnitus, low-frequency hearing loss, repeated episodes of vertigo.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Complete audiological evaluation.Includes pure-tone air and bone conduction, speech audiometry, tympanometry, and otoacoustic emissions.Typically reveals sensorineural hearing loss mainly in the low frequencies, although other configurations of hearing losses may be present.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Small acoustic tumours typically present as unilateral high-frequency hearing loss with difficulty hearing on the telephone on affected ear. Word discrimination score is greatly reduced when compared with pure-tone air and bone conduction testing (phonemic regression); rollover phenomenon, absent or elevated acoustic reflexes, abnormal findings on stapedial reflex decay, and abnormal auditory brainstem response.Hearing tests may be normal in patients with small acoustic neuromas.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI with gadolinium contrast will show a tumour involving the acoustic nerve.</p>",
