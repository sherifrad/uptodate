"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Difficult to distinguish from SARS based on symptomatology as both cause a febrile lower respiratory tract illness. Historical risk-factors may prove useful as avian influenza is more commonly associated with travel to a country affected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus or direct contact with poultry or birds that may be carriers of H5N1.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pharyngeal swab: positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for H5-specific RNA.Immunofluorescence antigen test: positive for antigen of H5N1 virus.Viral culture: growth of H5N1.Serological testing: positive for H5N1-specific antibody.</p>",
