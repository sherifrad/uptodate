"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tic disorders are a clinical spectrum that ranges from mild transient tics to Tourette syndrome. [2]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Clinical diagnosis, made by fulfilling criteria for Tourette syndrome: [16]Both multiple motor tics and &ge;1 vocal tics must be present at the same time, although not necessarily concurrently.The tics must occur many times a day (usually in bouts), nearly every day or intermittently over &gt;1 year, during which time there must not have been a tic-free period of &gt;3 consecutive months.The age at onset must be &lt;18 years.The disturbance must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., stimulants) or a general medical condition (e.g., Huntington's disease or postviral encephalitis).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> If the patient experiences alteration of consciousness, or if the movements cannot be temporarily suppressed or controlled, the patient may be experiencing focal motor seizures or myoclonic seizures and not motor tics. [1]  [3]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If the history does not differentiate tics from seizures, an EEG is indicated.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The diagnosis of PANDAS and its association with tic disorders remains controversial. [17]PANDAS is characterised by at least 2 episodes of abrupt onset of tics and obsessive-compulsive behaviours, following a group A streptococcal infection in children between 3 and 12 years of age.An episodic (relapsing, remitting) course, distinct from the smoother waxing, waning course typical in tic disorder.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Positive throat culture for group A streptococci associated in time with an exacerbation of tic symptoms.ASO titers and antiDNase B will be elevated if symptoms have been present for &gt;1 week. [11]  [14]ASO titres can be repeated during remission periods to document temporal association. However, the presence of elevated ASO titres only identifies prior infections and does not demonstrate causality.The American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have jointly released a scientific statement that states that they do not recommend laboratory testing for PANDAS.
