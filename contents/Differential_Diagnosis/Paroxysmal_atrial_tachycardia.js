"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This arrhythmia is usually compensatory for a reduced stroke volume because of heart failure or volume depletion, or because of sympathetic stimulation from pain, fear, or exogenous catecholamines.The presence of a clinical disease state plus variation in the atrial rate will usually differentiate this arrhythmia from atrial tachycardia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Vagal manoeuvres/adenosine will cause sinus tachycardia to transiently slow down, with slowing of the sinus rate and prolongation of the PR interval before AV block (if it occurs).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This supraventricular tachycardia shares many of the causes of PAT. Hence, the 2 may be indistinguishable based on history and physical examination.On vagal manoeuvres or administering adenosine, in contrast with PAT, AV node re-entrant tachycardia will abruptly cease. After a pause, sinus rhythm will resume.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The 12-lead ECG may show P waves, which can be differentiated from the P waves of atrial tachycardia by the shortened RP interval created by retrograde activation of the atria.The P waves in atrial tachycardia are found in the second half of the tachycardia cycle (long RP/short PR intervals).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This supraventricular tachycardia shares many of the causes of PAT. Hence, the 2 may be indistinguishable based on history and physical examination.Vagal manoeuvres/adenosine will transiently slow the ventricular response rate with AV block. The characteristic flutter waves will be revealed and will be unaffected.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The 12-lead ECG will show a regular tachycardia with the ventricular response rate being a multiple of the atrial flutter rate (usually 300 bpm).Unmedicated flutter will usually present in 2:1 AV block with the ventricular response being 148 to 150 bpm.The flutter waves will typically distort the baseline, particularly in leads II, III, and aVF.When AV block is induced in atrial tachycardia, there is an isoelectric interval between P waves, which is not seen in atrial flutter.</p>",
