"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Abrupt onset of symptoms. Headache and retrobulbar pain that worsens with eye movements is typical. A rash may be present in about half of patients and may be petechial or otherwise haemorrhagic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common.PCR may detect dengue virus in serum early in the illness. Isolation of virus by tissue culture is less common. Antibodies may be detected after resolution of the illness but are not helpful in the acute phase.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Pneumonia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Respiratory symptoms prominent, (e.g., cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, chest pain).Respiratory examination may reveal focal coarse crackles or consolidation. Hypoxia is common. Signs of pleural effusion may be present (e.g., dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds over affected area).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Neutrophilia is often present. CRP may be markedly elevated.Chest x-ray may demonstrate infiltrates or consolidation with or without effusion.Sputum culture may reveal the causative organism.Less commonly, blood cultures may be positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae.Urinary antigen testing is available for certain organisms.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Influenza</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Important to consider current epidemiological situation, (e.g., pandemics, epidemics, winter months). May give history of ill contacts. Short incubation period (1 to 2 days) with abrupt onset. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms common (e.g., non-productive cough, pharyngitis, coryza).Wheezing or rhonchi may be audible on auscultation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Viral culture of nasopharyngeal swabs is disappearing from practice. PCR, often including other respiratory viruses, is commonly used, providing a rapid and sensitive diagnosis.Serological diagnosis rests on demonstrating a change in titre between acute and convalescent samples and is not helpful in the acute period.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Enteric fever (typhoid infection)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Most common on Indian subcontinent. Incubation period 1 to 3 weeks. Gradual onset of sustained fever. Rigors uncommon. Abdominal pain and headache common.Relative bradycardia unreliable. May have a blanching erythematous maculopapular rash (rose spots).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Isolation of Salmonella typhi or S paratyphi in blood, stool, or urine cultures. Occasionally bone marrow culture is necessary.The Widal test is widely used but has poor sensitivity and specificity.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Pyogenic infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Focal symptoms and signs depend on site affected. May also have prominent systemic symptoms with Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection or pyelonephritis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Neutrophilia and markedly elevated CRP. Investigations depend on site affected.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Leptospirosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Conjuctival congestion may be helpful if present. Symptoms and signs of meningitis may be present (e.g., headache, neck stiffness, photophobia). Weil disease is a syndrome of hepatosplenomegaly with jaundice, bleeding diatheses, and renal failure.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Detection of specific IgM response by the end of the first week of the illness. PCR may also be useful.Isolation of leptospires from blood or CSF requires special media and is not routinely done.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Infectious mononucleosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical syndrome usually caused by Epstein Barr virus (EBV).Characterised by fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy in older children and young adults.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Peripheral lymphocytosis seen in 70% of cases. [40]  Lymphocytes appear atypical on blood film.Heterophile antibodies positive in 90% at some point, but false positives occur.Serology for specific antibodies is widely available and is highly sensitive and specific.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>HIV seroconversion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of unprotected sexual contact or sexually acquired infection. Lymphadenopathy and widespread erythematous rash.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> HIV test positive (may be negative in window period).Leukopenia common.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Amoebic liver abscess</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Preceding history of dysentery in fewer than 50% of patients. More common in young males.Right upper quadrant pain, possibly referred to the right shoulder. Tender hepatomegaly and right pleural effusion present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Neutrophilia and elevated alkaline phosphatase.Serology helpful.Stool microscopy may show Entamoeba cysts. Aspirated material contains trophozoites, and PCR is sensitive.Abdominal ultrasound or CT will demonstrate abscess.Chest x-ray may show pleural effusion.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section9'>African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of a tsetse fly bite.Detection of a chancre at the site of the bite, and enlarged lymph nodes. There may be a patchy erythematous rash.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Microscopy indicates the presence of trypomastigotes in peripheral blood, lymph node aspirates, or CSF.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section10'>Rickettsial infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section10'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May have a history of a tick bite or of spending time on safari.Headache is prominent. May have an eschar or rash.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Possile leukopenia and/or abnormal LFTs.Positive serology, but results will not be available in real time.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section11'>Legionnaires' disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section11'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acquired by inhalation of aerosolised bacteria or, rarely, microaspiration of contaminated drinking water.Presentation includes respiratory symptoms such as cough (may not be productive) and SOB, fever, chills, and chest pain. Other symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sputum Gram stain may show gram-negative rods suggestive of Legionella species.Cultures of lower respiratory tract secretions, pleural fluid, lung, blood, or extrapulmonary tissue or fluids show positive growth of Legionella species.Chest x-ray shows a lobar infiltrate.</p>",
