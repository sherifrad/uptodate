"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Depending on the type of fracture and severity, patients may experience elbow swelling, deformity, crepitus, and paraesthesia or numbness.Some patients may not have severe pain at rest, but elbow flexion and forearm rotations are limited and painful.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Views of the forearm in orthogonal planes (planes at 90&deg; to each other) are needed with the wrist and elbow joints included.Separate radiographs of the elbow should also be obtained to assess the proximal radioulnar joint, ulnohumeral articulation, and radiocapitellar joint.</p>",
