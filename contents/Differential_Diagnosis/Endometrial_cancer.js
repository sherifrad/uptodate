"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Commonly presents with abnormal uterine bleeding. [15]If woman is pre-menopausal, she may have a history of irregular heavy periods or amenorrhoea. If woman is post-menopausal, history and physical examination are indistinguishable from endometrial cancer.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Endometrial biopsy is the only test that may differentiate endometrial hyperplasia from cancer. [15]Even then, endometrial cancer may be present in up to 30% of cases when the initial diagnosis is hyperplasia with atypia. [16]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually asymptomatic, but when polyps are the cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding, the history is no different from cancer.Occasionally, pelvic examination reveals an exocervical polyp.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Transvaginal ultrasound may show thickened endometrial lining that is not uniform.Saline infusion sonohysterogram demonstrates polyps well.MRI will also demonstrate polyps, but is not usually necessary.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More common in younger, pre-menopausal women.Pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and painful defecation are key features of this condition.Physical examination will detect tenderness and may detect typical nodularity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pelvic ultrasound may show endometrioma.If a tissue biopsy is obtained, it shows characteristic benign endometrioid glands associated with changes of haemorrhage including haemosiderin-laden macrophages.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are typically younger, may be multi-parous, and usually have not had a cervical Pap smear for a long time.Vaginal bleeding is usually provoked (e.g., by sexual intercourse).Sometimes, there is associated offensive discharge.Physical examination shows an abnormal-looking cervix, and there may be an exophytic cauliflower growth.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Colposcopy may show a mass lesion on the cervix.Cervical biopsy and histopathology will show invasive squamous cell carcinoma, often associated with an in-situ component.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Commonly associated with cervical stenosis, and there may be a history of recent cervical surgery.Patients may be febrile and have other symptoms of sepsis.Physical examination may reveal an enlarged, tender uterus.Can be associated with an occult endometrial carcinoma, especially in older women.",
