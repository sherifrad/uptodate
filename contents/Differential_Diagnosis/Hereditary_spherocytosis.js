"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The FBC and blood smear appearances are typical for each type of anaemia and do not typically have the same appearance as HS (i.e., normal or reduced Hb, increased reticulocytes and spherocytes on the blood smear).Iron deficiency anaemia (most common cause of anaemia): FBC and blood smear reveal a microcytic (low MCV), hypochromic (increased central pallor) anaemia; if performed, serum ferritin is low.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC and blood smear help to confirm specific diagnosis.Spherocytes may not be present on the blood smear. Schistocytes are indicative of a microangiopathic process (e.g., DIC, TTP, haemolytic uraemic syndrome) or a traumatic process (e.g., mechanical prosthetic heart valve, march haemolysis). Elliptocytes may indicate elliptocytosis. Blister or bite cells indicate the presence of oxidant damage to the cell. Spur cells may occur with liver disease. RBC inclusions may occur with infections (e.g., malaria, babesiosis, and Bartonella infections).The direct anti-globulin test (DAT) is usually positive in auto-immune haemolytic anaemia. A negative DAT makes auto-immune haemolysis very unlikely.Hb electrophoresis detects haemoglobinopathy.Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is diagnosed by fluorescent spot test, followed by definitive assay of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity by spectrophotometry tests.Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 tests for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.There is abnormal renal function with haemolytic uraemic syndrome or TTP.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood smear may reveal morphology that is atypical for HS. Further specialist investigation may be required for atypical cases (e.g., quantitative protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). [13]The eosin-5-maleimide binding test may be abnormal in other red-cell disorders, particularly congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II .Maternal screen and a positive DAT in an infant detects irregular maternal antibody as a cause of neonatal spherocytosis.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) (various different patterns of specific liver enzyme abnormality depending on the condition) are an indicator of liver dysfunction. LFTs will usually be normal in HS apart from elevated unconjugated bilirubin.Screening for infectious hepatitis will be positive if this is the cause of jaundice, but negative in HS. However, HS can present during an exacerbation due to intercurrent infection (e.g., infectious mononucleosis), which may be associated with deranged LFTs.Neonatal blood smears can be difficult to interpret and the osmotic fragility may be normal, even with HS. Review of the blood smear after a period of time may be needed before a definite diagnosis is made. The typical smear appearances of spherocytes in HS are easier to see after a few months.</p>",
