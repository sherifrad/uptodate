"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with severe pain, swelling, and redness of the affected joint, which is often the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe.Gout can be seen in patients with sickle cell disease who have associated renal disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Joint aspiration shows negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents with fever and swelling of the affected joint.Suspect in sudden onset of monoarthritis.Patients at risk include those exposed to recent bacteraemia from pneumonia or UTI, or with history of IV drug use, rheumatoid arthritis, prosthetic joint, or immunocompromise.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Joint aspiration will show a purulent effusion, high WBC count, positive Gram stain, and positive culture.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with butterfly rash; photosensitivity; swollen, painful, and stiff metacarpophalangeal joints; anaemia; and vasculitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serological work-up may show ANA and/or RF positivity.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Avascular necrosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with pain typically in the hip or shoulder and can be differentiated from a vaso-occlusive crisis by its chronicity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI of the affected joint would show no difference between avascular necrosis caused by sickle cell disease and necrosis caused by other aetiologies (e.g., injury or joint dislocation).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Perthes' disease</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Condition of childhood characterised by necrosis of femoral epiphysis. Usually seen in children 4 to 10 years of age.May be associated with thrombophilia. [17]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> X-ray is diagnostic. Maybe difficult to distinguish from sickle cell osteonecrosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Acute abdomen</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Vaso-occlusive crises owing to small infarct of the abdominal viscera must be differentiated from other acute abdominal disorders. For example, acute cholecystitis presents with RUQ pain (worse after eating fatty foods), nausea and vomiting, and a positive Murphy's sign. Meanwhile, acute pancreatitis typically presents with abdominal/epigastric pain that radiates to the back.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Amylase and lipase are elevated in pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasound in pancreatitis may show ascites, gallstones, dilated common bile duct, and an enlarged pancreas. In cholecystitis, ultrasound may show gallstones or a thickened gallbladder wall.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Osteomyelitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Painful bone episodes in sickle cell anaemia are clinically indistinguishable from those experienced in osteomyelitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI bone scans do not confidently differentiate the two conditions.Persistent pain localised to one area, especially in a febrile patient, suggests the possibility of osteomyelitis.Blood cultures positive for Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Escherichia coli favour diagnosis of osteomyelitis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain and signs of injury related to the site of trauma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> If trauma is suspected in a child who cannot communicate, imaging of the affected area is helpful, along with close observation.</p>",
