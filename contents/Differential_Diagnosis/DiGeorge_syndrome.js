"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fetal exposure to isotretinoins, such as those used for acne, causes the syndrome known as retinoic acid embryopathy, which can result in similar features to DiGeorge syndrome. [53]  [54]  [55]  [56]  A history of isotretinoin exposure is useful in differentiating this syndrome. More common in this syndrome than in 22qDS are microtia or anotia, micrognathia, and spontaneous abortion. [53]",
