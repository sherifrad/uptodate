"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Approximately one third of patients report a febrile illness preceding the symptoms. Most have leg weakness of varying degrees of severity. The arms are involved in a minority of cases.Associated illnesses include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV infection, and sarcoidosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF analysis shows pleocytosis with a modest number of lymphocytes and increase in total protein.MRI shows focal demyelination with possible enhancement at the appropriate level. Lyme titres are occasionally found to be high. [35]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Two-thirds have a history of gastroenteritis or influenza-like illness weeks before onset of neurological symptoms. It is frequently severe and presents with features which are similar to those of spinal cord compression, as an ascending paralysis initially with weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper limbs and the face, along with complete loss of deep tendon reflexes. Autonomic signs may be present in some variations. May develop progressive respiratory muscle weakness requiring ventilation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Typical CSF findings include albumin-cytological dissociation, that is, an elevated protein level (1-10 g/L or 100-1000 mg/dL) without an accompanying increased cell count. A sustained increased WBC count may indicate an alternative diagnosis such as infection.Electrodiagnostics (EMG and nerve conduction studies) may show prolonged distal latencies, conduction slowing, conduction block, and temporal dispersion of compound action potential in demyelinating cases. In primary axonal damage, the findings include reduced amplitude of the action potentials without conduction slowing. [36]Nearly 40% of patients are seropositive for Campylobacter jejuni. [37]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of HIV infection or high-risk behaviours (IV drug use, HIV-infected blood transfusion, unprotected sex).Signs and symptoms referable to the spinal cord lesions, including paraparesis, often accompanied by spasticity or ataxia (or both) coupled with dementia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ELISA testing should be ordered when HIV testing is indicated. False-negatives may occur during window period immediately after infection and before antibodies to HIV have developed. A positive result should be confirmed with a Western blot or second ELISA. The window period can be reduced to 2 to 4 weeks by using fourth-generation tests and those that include IgM antibodies to HIV.CSF, microbiological, and spinal imaging studies may be inconclusive or non-specific.

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents as a combination of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) symptoms and signs.Approximately 60% of ALS patients experience muscle weakness and stiffness as the initial symptoms. The neurological examination usually shows evidence of muscle weakness (localised or widespread, depending on the extent of the disease). The examination also reveals muscle atrophy. The muscles may be so stiff that, when the neurologist moves them, they continue to move abnormally afterwards. When the neurologist tests the knee jerk reaction, the movement is abnormally quick (hyper-reflexia).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> EMG testing is a significant part of the diagnosis. The current criteria define a positive EMG when signs of active denervation include fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves, with fasciculation potentials. [40]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Multiple sclerosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can mimic clinical symptoms of spinal cord compression. However, in almost all cases of multiple sclerosis there are also brain lesions.Has a variable presentation with multiple episodes separated by space (i.e., neurological symptoms result from lesions in different CNS sites) and time. Common symptoms include progressive limb weakness, gait difficulty, ataxia, loss of balance, and paroxysmal vertigo.In the setting of acute paraparesis, visual symptoms (visual loss) may be present. This is neuromyelitis optica (NMO). NMO is thought to be a distinct entity from MS by many neurologists. It has a relapsing course (80% to 90%), and predominantly affects females. [41]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain MRI typically shows areas of demyelination.CSF examination shows raised IgG and oligoclonal banding.If NMO suspected (optic neuritis, myelitis, longitudinal cord lesion on MRI), NMO-IgG seropositivity. [41]</p>",
