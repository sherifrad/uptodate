"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> New-onset unilateral headache, jaw claudication associated with chewing tough foods, diffuse mandibular discomfort, dental discomfort, sinus pain and pressure, and/or tongue pain are associated with GCA. Blindness, diplopia, or blurry vision and an abnormally thickened, tender, erythematous, or nodular temporal artery are also found. [8]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A positive temporal artery biopsy showing a granulomatous vasculitis confirms the diagnosis of GCA; however, results may be positive in PMR patients without GCA symptoms.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presentation may be very similar to PMR; however, the absence of a prompt response to low-dose corticosteroids distinguishes the two. The peripheral musculoskeletal symptoms of late-onset RA do not respond rapidly. [5]  Some with RA will respond to 10 to 20 mg of prednisolone.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated rheumatoid factor and persistently raised plasma viscosity. [24]  Positive anti-CCP antibody assays. [3]  Anti-CCP assays were 61.4% sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of late-onset RA. [25]Repeat x-ray of hands, delayed for months after the initial test, is performed to assess other affected joint damage. [5]</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May show similar signs of muscle and joint pain, weakness in the extremities, and fatigue; however, delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes (a rare finding) is strongly suggestive of hypothyroidism. [5]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An elevated TSH helps to differentiate hypothyroidism. [5]  Creatine phosphokinase may also be elevated.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Fibromyalgia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Compared with PMR, fibromyalgia pain tends to be more widespread and is not associated with shoulder/hip girdle stiffness. The pain does not typically improve with 10 to 20 mg of daily prednisolone as is characteristic of PMR. [5]  [26]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The ESR and CRP are normal [26]</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Paraneoplastic syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with constitutional symptoms and proximal muscle pain easily confused with the shoulder and hip girdle stiffness found in PMR. Paraneoplastic syndrome symptoms usually do not respond to low-dose corticosteroid treatment. A thorough tumour work-up should be reserved for those unresponsive to low-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Removal of the tumour leads to a resolution of symptoms. [1]The Lambert-Eaton syndrome, a paraneoplastic condition associated with small-cell lung cancer, may cause proximal weakness that improves later in the day, a feature similar to the symptoms of PMR.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tumour screening includes routine baseline tests including a CXR, an FBC, a chemistry panel, and urinalysis. Age-appropriate cancer screening tests should also be performed (i.e., faecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy, mammogram). Additional specialised testing should be directed by the history, the examination findings, and any abnormalities found on the routine CXR and laboratory tests.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Polymyositis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symmetrical weakness of shoulder and pelvic girdles. [5]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated muscle enzyme levels (i.e., creatine phosphokinase) often with a positive anti-nuclear antibody titre. Characteristic changes in electromyography associated with polymyositis include increased needle insertional activity, spontaneous fibrillations, low-amplitude, short-duration polyphasic motor potentials, and complex repetitive discharges. Diagnosis is confirmed with muscle biopsy, indicating immune cell infiltration and destruction of muscle fibres. [5]</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> No systemic symptoms as in PMR. Typically unilateral shoulder involvement without bilateral involvement. [5]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A normal ESR helps exclude PMR; however, about 20% of PMR patients have a normal result. [5]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Polyarthritis and bilateral oedema of both hands found typically in individuals older than 50 years. [27]  [28]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI shows predominantly a tenosynovitis. [28]  [5]  Serum vascular endothelial growth factor may be useful in diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity, but this is not currently standard practice. [29]</p>",
