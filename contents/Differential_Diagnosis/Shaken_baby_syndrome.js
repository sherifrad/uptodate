"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of trauma: more major trauma such as window falls and motor vehicle accidents will usually be witnessed and documented by police or paramedics.Physical examination will usually reveal bruising related to a fall, although in some cases scalp bruising may be deep and therefore not visible externally.Ophthalmological examination is usually completely negative, although in crush injuries or instances where the eye received a direct blow there may be a small number of retinal haemorrhages.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT head: although skull fracture and subdural haemorrhage may be present, it is rare for accidental household falls to result in significant brain injury.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The incidence of asymptomatic parturitional trauma appears to range from 10% to 26% of all newborns, with decreasing frequency after forceps, vaginal, and caesarean deliveries. Resolves by 4 to 6 weeks of age. [40]  [41]If a birth-related haemorrhage is severe enough to cause symptoms, this will occur in the newborn period. The new onset of symptoms and signs of inflicted traumatic brain injury in a child who was asymptomatic at birth is not consistent with birth-related subdural haemorrhage.Retinal haemorrhages are seen in 30% to 50% of births, are generally few in number, and present in the intraretinal layer. They can be bilateral and widespread; most resolve within 1 or 2 weeks, and the remainder are gone in 6 to 8 weeks. [27]  [42]  [43]  Widespread retinal haemorrhages after 6 to 8 weeks of age are of concern for abusive head trauma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Distinguishing between inflicted injury and birth trauma is based on historical factors of the birth as well as the current presentation of injury.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fever and clinical signs of meningismus.Generally, parents give hx of progressively worsening illness.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> LP and CSF analysis: increased number of WBCs, visualisation of bacteria on microscopy, low glucose, high protein, positive culture for organism, positive serology for viruses.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pre-existing condition of BESS may predispose infants to the occurrence of subdural bleeding with minor trauma.Usually asymptomatic, absence of retinal haemorrhages; no other signs of abuse.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cranial imaging: enlargement of subarachnoid space with subdural bleeding that is often unilateral, not space-occupying, or associated with signs of brain oedema or injury such as contusion, diffuse axonal injury, or tissue shearing.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Positive FHx (autosomal recessive), microcephaly, motor delay, and mental retardation. [34]  Retinal haemorrhages may be present.A genetics/metabolism team should be consulted if there is any possibility of glutaric aciduria type I. [25]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT head: frontotemporal brain atrophy, subdural fluid collections that sometimes contain blood.Urine screen: increased levels of glutaric, glutaconic, and 3-hydroxyglutaric acids.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Positive FHx (autosomal dominant), hx of fractures after minor trauma, discoloration of the sclera to a blue-grey colour (types 1 and 3), poor muscle tone.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Skin biopsy and culture of fibroblasts should be performed, enabling a collagen synthesis assay that may show quantitative or qualitative differences in collagen in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.Mutation analysis of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes from fibroblast RNA may also be performed.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clues in presentation depend on type of rickets. Nutritional deficiency is common if children are breastfed without vitamin D supplementation.Bone deformities of the forearms and posterior bowing of the distal tibia can occur in infants.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Typically low calcium and vitamin D levels in hypocalcaemic rickets; however, biochemical profile does vary depending on type of rickets.</p>",
