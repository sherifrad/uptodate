"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Clinical history is the most helpful discriminator.Occurs in the setting of pre-existing renal disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Kidney size and cysts are usually small, as opposed to enlarged kidneys usually seen in ADPKD; however, kidneys may increase in size and resemble those of ADPKD.Haemorrhage often seen on imaging.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common in adults. Incidence increases with age; tend to be uncommon in people &lt;40 years of age.Absence of family history and not meeting the Ravine's criteria is helpful. [38]Rarely leads to significant pain, rupture, or infection.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis made on ultrasound. Criteria include absence of internal echoes; strong, sharply defined distant wall with smooth distinct margins; acoustic enhancement; and a spherical or slightly ovoid shape.Bosniak's classification is used to classify renal cysts and defines appropriate management.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI of kidneys reveals renal cysts typically at the corticomedullary junction.Magnetic resonance urography shows a medullary nephrogram or a ring-shaped contrast enhancement along the base of the papillae. Thin-cut CT may also be helpful.UMOD gene mutation analysis (MCKD2), if positive, confirms diagnosis. However, there is a second disease locus for the MCKD1 locus; therefore, mutation analysis will not completely exclude medullary cystic kidney disease if negative.Commercial testing is available.</p>",
