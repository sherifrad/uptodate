"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presentation may be identical, but less likely to include meningismus or fever.Infectious source absent.Presentation over a protracted period, with symptoms lasting several weeks to months, favours the diagnosis of neoplasm.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> WBC count, ESR, and CRP are generally not elevated. [33]  MRI more often demonstrates a heterogenous appearance. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) lacks succinate, acetate, and amino acid elevations. Ultimately differentiated by surgical sampling of the lesion.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Rarely exhibits fever and meningismus. Infectious source absent.History or signs and symptoms of the primary neoplasm may be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, or possibly bone scan or mammogram, reveal the primary lesion in most cases. Occasionally presents as a cryptogenic lesion. Tissue diagnosis by surgical biopsy or resection is definitive.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Time course generally distinguishes radiation necrosis, which occurs after a full course of radiotherapy.Often asymptomatic. Fever and meningeal signs absent.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated WBC count more indicative of abscess unless the patient remains on corticosteroids.MRI generally shows fluid in the surgical cavity that is consistent with a purulent collection in brain abscess.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) lacks peaks associated with metabolic activity in radiation necrosis.If suspicion persists, surgical re-exploration is indicated.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Longer history of protean neurological symptoms.Fevers and meningismus absent.Occurs in characteristic population.Presence of specific signs: Lhermitte's sign (transient electric-like shocks extending down the spine), Uhthoff's sign (episodic transient obscuration of vision).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CSF analysis, if LP is performed, shows characteristics of MS.MRI demonstrates exclusively white matter lesions that fluctuate over time and vary with their degree of enhancement.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of prior inflammatory event or vaccination.More common in children and patients from tropical climates.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> MRI shows lesion restricted to white matter. Evoked potentials consistent with demyelination.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Ischaemic stroke</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lack of fever and meningeal signs. Presents as sudden neurological deficit that is relatively stable afterwards. Headache is rare.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Lack of elevated ESR, CRP, WBC count. MRI rarely exhibits contrast enhancement except for pseudolaminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted images on MRI show characteristic findings depending on timing of study.Limited to a single vascular distribution.</p>",
