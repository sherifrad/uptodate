"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History and examination suggest an underlying cause of hypoxia.Possible scenarios include smoking and sleep apnoea, but other causes of lung disease need to be considered.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Room air oxygen saturation &lt;92% suggests significant hypoxia.ABG confirms the result.Overnight oximetry can be abnormal in people with sleep apnoea. However, it is questionable whether sleep apnoea alone is sufficient to produce an erythrocytosis without other contributing factors, so these people should be screened for other underlying lung disease as well.PFT (spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) is abnormal in people with underlying lung disease.Erythropoietin level is normal or elevated with secondary polycythaemia but usually low and occasionally normal in PV.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Examination is frequently indistinguishable, although these patients do not have plethoric findings.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No test absolutely differentiates.Usually no history of elevated Hb.A normal erythropoietin, isolated thrombocytosis, and absence of elevated Hb concentration favour essential thrombocytosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be clinically indistinguishable, although thrombosis is much less common with CML.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Screening for Philadelphia chromosome 9;22 translocation is almost always positive in CML.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> There may be evidence of the presence of an erythropoietin-secreting tumour.There may be a family history of familial polycythaemias such as Chuvash polycythaemia.Patient may be receiving exogenous erythropoietin.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Imaging studies, as clinically appropriate following history and examination, may demonstrate erythropoietin-secreting tumour. The following may be abnormal: abdominal CT, MRI, or ultrasound; brain MRI or CT scan with contrast; CXR.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of exogenous testosterone supplementation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> No other differentiating tests required following appropriate history.Unless there is a clear history that the polycythaemia only began with the initiation of testosterone, a trial period off testosterone to test if haemoglobin returns to normal can be done.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Congenital polycythaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Appropriate family history can be helpful but is not always revealing.Autosomal dominant history suggests erythropoietin receptor mutation, mutation of HIF2 alpha gene, or high-affinity Hb.Recessive history suggests Chuvash polycythaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Specialised genetic tests will be positive for the particular congenital disorder present.</p>",
