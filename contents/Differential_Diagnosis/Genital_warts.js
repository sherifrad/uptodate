"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> One of the manifestations of secondary syphilis.Patients may have associated systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever, malaise, adenopathy, and weight loss.The lesions appear as moist, whitish, wart-like papules, and are highly contagious.View imageLesions relapse in approximately 20% of patients without treatment within a year. [3]  [36]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Direct detection of treponemes in specimen under dark-field microscopy is diagnostic.Serological tests for syphilis, such as rapid plasma reagin (RPR), may be helpful.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A viral infection of the epidermis that manifests as flesh-coloured papules that are often umbilicated.View imageThe infection is self-limited and lesions persist for up to 6 months.Occurs in children and sexually active adults. In children, the lesions are seen on exposed skin, but in sexually active adults, lesions occur in the genital region.In HIV-positive patients, the clinical presentation is generally more severe with a greater number of lesions and larger lesions that may involve the face.These lesions are usually asymptomatic unless secondarily infected, in which case they may be painful. [3]  [37]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is usually clinical. However, direct microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained central core shows molluscum or inclusion bodies.Biopsy may be indicated in HIV-infected patients to rule out fungal infection.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pearly penile papules are a normal anatomic variant of the glans that appear as flesh-coloured, discrete papules approximately 1 to 2 mm in size, distributed evenly around the corona.They are asymptomatic but may generate anxiety in the patient. [3]  [37]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Common, benign verrucous lesions that may vary in colour from tan to brown to gray to black. They have a classic 'stuck-on' appearance.View imageThey evolve over months to years and rarely occur before the age of 30. [3]  [37]The lesions tend to appear on the face, torso, and upper extremities.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May appear as multifocal erythematous macules, lichenoid, or pigmented papules sometimes forming plaques on the external anogenital region. The surface is usually smooth and velvety.Ulceration suggests invasiveness. Cervix and anus involvement have the highest risk to become invasive.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical; however, it should always be confirmed by biopsy.Dermatopathology shows epidermal proliferation with numerous abnormal mitoses, dyskeratotic cells, and atypical pleomorphic cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei. [37]</p>",
