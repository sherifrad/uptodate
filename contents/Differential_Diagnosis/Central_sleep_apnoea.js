"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Significant snoring, higher BMI, less sleep-maintenance insomnia, crowded oropharynx, and a short and thick neck are suggestive of OSA but can also be seen in CSA.OSA and CSA can and often do co-exist.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Polysomnography shows apnoeas accompanied by significant and paradoxical abdominal and chest wall movements not seen in central apnoeas. [1]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in obesity hypoventilation, in patients with a ventilatory control problem, or in patients with a neurological muscular disorder who cannot ventilate appropriately.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ABGs show hypercapnia in sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxaemic syndromes, unlike CSA where most patient have hypocapnia or eucapnia. [1]Results from chronic hypoventilation and waking hypercapnia.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Depression</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Early morning awakening.Overt sleepiness is quite uncommon, and observed breathing patterns (in patients without concurrent sleep-disordered breathing diagnoses) are normal.Morning headaches are unusual.Other symptoms of depression should be present, such as dysphoria, anhedonia, and altered appetite.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Patients with depression most often have abnormal results on standardised depression scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Orthopnoea often accompanies poorly controlled CHF with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Medical management of CHF should be optimised. If symptom remains, polysomnography may be necessary to determine the cause.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Restless leg syndrome (RLS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A characteristic history of RLS may be obtained, including an unpleasant sensation in the legs, which almost demand movement (often difficult to describe, but occasionally described as creepy-crawly, cramping, or fidgety sensations), worse in the evening, worse during immobility, and transiently improved by movement of the affected limbs.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> RLS is diagnosed by a careful history.Polysomnogram-associated features may include periodic limb movements, but polysomnography is not necessary to make the diagnosis in adults.</p>",

"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Temporal relationship between onset of symptoms and initiation or increase in dose of candidate medications.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Most helpful is a careful review of medications and their adverse-effect profile.If a medication is strongly suspected, improvement in the symptom upon removal of the medication supports this diagnosis. However, this may not always be possible.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Hypersomnia due to inadequate sleep</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The sleep history will reveal marked restriction of sleep, such that even patients who are excellent sleepers experience chronic sleep deprivation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A careful sleep history is often adequate.In more perplexing cases, a sleep diary kept by a spouse or carer, or even actigraphy, which continuously measures gross motor activity, may be required to obtain an accurate assessment of sleep time and pattern.</p>",
