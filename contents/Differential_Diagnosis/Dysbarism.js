"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Contamination of breathing gas is rare, but carbon monoxide poisoning has occurred, causing symptoms such as headache, delirium, and loss of consciousness. [39]  The gas may smell or taste oily, and symptoms may be present in other divers who have breathed gas from the same source.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Analysis of the breathing gas and measurement of carboxy-haemoglobin levels will confirm exposure.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Hypercapnia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Strenuous exertion or 'skip breathing' (intentional hypoventilation) while underwater can cause severe headache during or after a dive. Decompression illness will normally exhibit other features in addition to headache.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Hyperventilation</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May cause transient peripheral paraesthesia in the hands, especially if the diver is anxious or dyspnoeic. Accompanying subjective dizziness or perceptual disturbances may complicate diagnosis, but the symptoms subside once the diver is calm, or are relieved by re-breathing into an airtight container.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Diagnosis is clinical.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section3'>Near drowning</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> An obvious history of water aspiration favours near drowning, whereas in decompression illness symptoms in other systems are often present. However, cardiopulmonary manifestations of decompression illness may resemble those of near drowning (dyspnoea, cough, chest pain, pulmonary oedema). The two diagnoses may co-exist, and if in doubt, recompression is advised.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR may show signs of water aspiration.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Pulmonary oedema</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Immersion in water may spontaneously cause pulmonary oedema, and exertion at depth may precipitate cardiac failure. [40]Symptoms are pulmonary only (rather than multi-system, as in decompression illness) and develop at depth (rather than during or after ascent, as in decompression illness). The symptoms become worse during ascent, since available oxygen diminishes. Difficult to distinguish clinically from pulmonary barotrauma in the acute setting.",

"<dt><a href='#Section6'>Envenomation or toxin ingestion</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Suggested by a history of fish or shellfish ingestion, or by a bite, sting, or unusual mark on examination. Marine animal envenomation or ingestion of seafood toxins can produce a wide range of local and systemic symptoms consistent with decompression illness.",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Migraine</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Diving can trigger an attack and symptoms such as headache, visual disturbance, and hemiparesis.

"<dd id='Section16'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History and examination may point to a traumatic cause for musculoskeletal pains, which are common in divers.

"<dt><a href='#Section17'>Infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section17'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Non-specific malaise and generalised myalgia may be mistaken for the constitutional symptoms of decompression illness.

"<dd id='Section18'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The effects of chronic analgesic or sedative medication over-use, and the adverse effects of certain drugs (e.g., mefloquine), may mimic subjective symptoms of decompression illness. [42]  Temporal relation of symptoms to drug ingestion may be diagnostic.Acute intoxication or hangover may cause neurological or behavioural changes, headache, nausea, and visual disturbances consistent with nitrogen narcosis. A history of ingestion together with the persistence of symptoms after ascent is diagnostic.",

"<dt><a href='#Section19'>Psychological problems, acute psychosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section19'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Inexperienced divers or those of a nervous disposition may focus on subjective symptoms to such an extent that exclusion of decompression illness may be impossible without recompression.Acute psychosis with thought disorder, delusions, or hallucinations may mimic nitrogen narcosis. Symptoms that persist after a return to atmospheric pressure are suggestive, whereas rapid reversibility of the symptoms with ascent generally confirms the diagnosis of nitrogen narcosis.",

"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section22'>Acute exacerbation of asthma</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section22'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A past medical history of asthma in a diver needs careful assessment. Dry compressed gas, exercise, saltwater aspiration, and anxiety are all potential triggers for an asthma attack while diving. Wheeze and diurnal variation of symptoms are rare in pulmonary barotrauma.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Inhalation of a beta-2 agonist will improve symptoms, and can be used to test the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section23'>GORD</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section23'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can occur during immersion, even with a normal lower oesophageal sphincter. [43]  Symptoms of reflux and aspiration of gastric contents may be similar to those of pulmonary barotrauma, although a prior history of GORD may be present.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Asymmetric middle-ear pressures on ascent may lead to unequal vestibular end-organ stimulation. This can be distinguished from ear barotrauma by its transient nature and the absence of otoscopic abnormalities.",

"<dt><a href='#Section34'>Epistaxis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section34'>",
