"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Classically, patients present in infancy with delayed separation of the umbilical cord, serious recurrent bacterial illness (typically of mucosa and skin), no pus formation, and poor wound healing. [1]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May present with infections similar to CGD, yet have a history of haemolytic anaemia triggered by fava beans or certain medications. [1]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically only associated with concurrent diabetes; these patients tend to have infections with Candida spp. [1]  [37]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CGD is excluded based on a normal DHR test.Of note, complete absence of myeloperoxidase activity can lead to decreased DHR histogram shift within neutrophils. [38]Lack of myeloperoxidase can be documented by direct staining of neutrophil intracellular myeloperoxidase and analysis by flow cytometry. [38]</p>",
