"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents as acute abdominal pain starting in the mid-abdomen and later localising to the RLQ. Associated with fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and elevated neutrophil count.May be clinically indistinguishable from Meckel's diverticulitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan shows a dilated appendix, and periappendiceal inflammatory changes, such as fat stranding of the mesoappendix or adjacent retroperitoneal fat. [26]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typically presents between 5 and 7 months of age with vomiting; older children also complain of abdominal pain. Often a history of progressive lethargy, and there may have been a recent viral illness.A palpable abdominal mass or abdominal distention may be found on examination.May be clinically indistinguishable from Meckel's diverticulitis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain abdominal x-ray reveals intestinal obstruction and paucity of gas in the RLQ, as well as often showing the characteristic 'target sign'.Abdominal ultrasound may establish the diagnosis, but contrast enema (air or contrast reagent) is the most specific and sensitive test for diagnosis, and it may be therapeutic.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Pain and tenderness, usually in the RUQ and sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting.Pain is most commonly triggered by fatty foods, but it can also be initiated by other types of food, or it can occur spontaneously.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abdominal ultrasound has a high specificity (&gt;98%) for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis and a negative predictive value of 95% for the diagnosis of cholecystitis. [27]</p>",
