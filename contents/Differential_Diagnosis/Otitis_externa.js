"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Acute otitis media and AOE present with ear pain. Hearing loss may be present in both. Tympanic membrane may be erythematous in AOE, making it more challenging to rule out either an associated acute otitis media or acute otitis media alone. Pneumatic otoscopy shows mobility of the tympanic membrane in AOE and limited or absent mobility in acute otitis media. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tympanometry will reveal a normal peaked curve in AOE but a flat (type B) curve in acute otitis media. [1]</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Furunculosis is sometimes referred to as localised AOE. [1]  It usually represents a localised infected hair follicle in the cartilaginous portion of the ear canal. [9]  The presenting symptoms are similar to those of diffuse AOE. It presents with otalgia and tenderness.On physical examination the infection is confined to the cartilaginous portion of the ear canal. [3]  The bony (medial) portion of the external auditory canal is usually normal.",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> This is an allergic reaction to antigens that could be present in hearing aid material, cosmetics, and other topical otic solutions. Patients usually give history of prior use of topical solutions.Among the topical solutions, neomycin is the most commonly implicated agent. [1]  Patients with allergies to otic topical solutions usually present with erythema and oedema that extend into the conchal bowl.",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Severe otalgia, facial paralysis or paresis, taste disturbance on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and decreased lacrimation on the affected side. [1]  Physical examination may reveal erythema and/or vesicles in the ear canal and auricle. [3]",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Chronic otitis externa is inflammation of the ear canal skin. It usually presents with diffuse low-grade infection of months' or, at times, years' duration. [8]  It is the result of recurrent otitis externa, bacterial or fungal infections, underlying skin conditions, or otorrhoea from middle ear infections. [3]  Patients usually present with itching and scant otorrhoea but no pain. [8]Physical examination of the ear varies, depending on the severity of the infection, and can range from dry skin to granulation tissue. [8]",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Recalcitrant to usual medical therapy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy of the external auditory canal. [1]</p>",

"<dd id='Section6'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Consider particularly in recalcitrant cases not responding to medical therapy. Otoscopy typically shows crust or keratin in the attic (upper part of the middle ear), the pars flaccida, or the pars tensa (usually posterior superior aspect), with or without a perforation of the tympanic membrane.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT can help with confirming the diagnosis, assessing disease extension, and treatment planning.</p>",
