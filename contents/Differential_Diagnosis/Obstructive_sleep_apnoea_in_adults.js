"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Recurrent episodes of apnoea with absence of respiratory effort. [1]CSB associated with CHF, renal failure, or cerebrovascular disease, which is not necessarily present with OSA. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Polysomnogram: in OSA there is evidence of thoraco-abdominal effort, whereas episodes of central apnoea are devoid of effort signal on thoraco-abdominal sensors. [1]  In CSB, a crescendo-decrescendo change in breathing amplitude interspersed by episodes of central apnoea or hypopnoea would be seen.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Level of sleepiness in narcolepsy may be higher on the Epworth Sleep Scale.   [Epworth Sleepiness Scale]Some patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. [1]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> OSA needs to be excluded or evidenced to be sufficiently treated. After OSA is excluded using polysomnography, a multiple sleep latency test (MLST) may be performed to assess for narcolepsy. [1]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be difficult to differentiate clinically.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Sleep diary and/or actigraphy should be used. However, total sleep time may still be under- or overestimated. Polysomnography is performed to rule out OSA if there are additional risk factors. [1]</p>",
