"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Unilateral or bilateral self-limiting swelling of the parotid gland. Orchitis or oophoritis may develop.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Usually a clinical diagnosis.IgM is positive for up to 4 weeks after infection, but testing should not be done in the first 3 days. May be falsely negative if previously immunised.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Usually bilateral (although unilateral parotid swelling has been reported), persistent, and only rarely mildly painful. Called Heerfordt's syndrome when accompanied by fever, uveitis, and facial palsy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Biopsy will show presence of non-caseating granulomas.Serum calcium level and 24-hour urinary calcium levels are often elevated.CXR: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy with or without pulmonary infiltrates.Serum ACE levels are often elevated.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May demonstrate chronic productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. Painless swelling of parotid glands is clinically indistinguishable in the absence of radiographic evidence of node calcification.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR: Infiltrates, cavities, or consolidation often in the upper lobes with lymphadenopathy.PPD is usually positive.PCR-based salivary assay to find evidence of mycobacterium tuberculosis has far better detection rate than culture.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Asymptomatic or symptomatic swelling of a salivary gland. Rapid growth, pain, ulceration, and facial palsy are suggestive of the presence of a malignancy. An indolent asymptomatic and growing mass is suggestive of the presence of a benign neoplasm, although lymphomas may display indolent behaviour.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan will show a solid mass clearly distinct from the surrounding tissues. Abscess formation is uniformly absent. In the absence of any evidence suggesting the presence of inflammation, FNA cytology is warranted. The presence of sialolithiasis argues against a tumour diagnosis.MRI offers excellent resolution of soft tissue structures including tumour and its relationship to surrounding structures.</p>",
