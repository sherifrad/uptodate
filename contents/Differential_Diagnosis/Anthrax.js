"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions of staphylococcal or streptococcal furunculosis are typically painful, whereas cutaneous anthrax lesions are painless. Bacterial furunculosis may also be suggested by the recurrence of fevers, lymphangitis, and purulent drainage. [2]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Wound Gram stain and cultures in bacterial furunculosis should reveal typical pathogens, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Occurs in patients with neutropenia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood cultures or tissue cultures will reveal typical pathogens associated with ecthyma gangrenosum, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus, and Candida.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> In cases of orf, a scab forms but the distinctive eschar of cutaneous anthrax is absent. In addition, the notable oedema associated with anthrax does not occur. Cases of orf are distinguished by clinical and historical clues relating to contact with infected sheep or goat flesh.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histological examination of orf reveals epidermal hyperplasia, necrosis, pseudoneoplastic vesicular proliferation, and dermal infiltration with eosinophilic dominance. [53]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Brown recluse spider bites are associated with pain, while lesions of cutaneous anthrax are classically painless. In addition, the notable oedema associated with anthrax does not occur. Cases of brown recluse spider bites occur in endemic regions. The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles, can be found in south-eastern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, northern Georgia, and southern portions of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa. [54]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Blood or wound cultures would not find B anthracis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms of malaise, fatigue, low-grade fever, and dyspnoea associated with early inhalational anthrax may resemble influenza. However, coryza, pharyngitis, and nasal congestion do not occur in cases of anthrax. [55]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Anthrax cases may be distinguished from influenza by the presence of a widened mediastinum on CXR. Rapid antigen assays and oropharyngeal viral cultures may be useful if positive for influenza.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Cardiovascular collapse secondary to a ruptured aortic aneurysm may occur alongside a history of cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, and HTN, not found with inhalational anthrax.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An x-ray shows mediastinal widening much like with a ruptured aortic aneurysm; however, mediastinal changes in anthrax occur early in the infection along with pulmonary oedema.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Nausea and vomiting may accompany both diagnoses; however, GI anthrax often has rebound abdominal tenderness, ascites, oropharyngeal mucosal ulceration, or pseudomembrane formation. [46]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cultures of blood, peritoneal fluid, or oropharyngeal secretions may yield B anthracis. Standard blood cultures effectively grow B anthracis in 6 to 24 hours. Further confirmatory testing (immunohistochemical staining, gamma phage, PCR assays) must be performed by a reference site of the Laboratory Response Network site, if in the US, or according to local protocols in other countries.
