"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Subacute onset of generalised, descending weakness with diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and respiratory failure. Prominent autonomic dysfunction with dilated pupils, hypotension, bradycardia, diarrhoea followed by constipation, and urinary retention. LES is differentiated by the subacute onset and by identifying exposure to botulinum toxin.Careful clinical examination is essential.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> May be distinguished from LES by post-exercise or post-tetanic facilitation that may last for minutes. Mouse bioassay to confirm botulinum toxin intoxication is available, although results may be delayed for several days.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Suggestive features include prominent ocular weakness that spares the pupils, and normal tendon reflexes. [32]Autonomic dysfunction is not caused by myasthenia gravis and is an important distinction between LES and myasthenia gravis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Abnormal post-exercise or tetanic facilitation (&gt;100%) usually differentiates LES from myasthenia gravis.The presence of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or MuSK antibodies strongly suggests MG, although up to 13% of patients with LES have AChR antibodies, and myasthenia gravis/LES overlap syndromes do occur rarely.

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Progressive weakness without autonomic features may be seen in mitochondrial, inflammatory, andsome late-onset muscular dystrophies. Fluctuation in strength or facilitation with exercise is not noted and reflexes are preserved. FHx is frequently positive in mitochondrial and late-onset muscular dystrophies.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevations in serum creatine kinase suggest a myopathic process, although they may be normal. EMG differentiates a myopathic process, whereas muscle biopsy is confirmatory.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Progressive weakness with loss of tendon reflexes; autonomic symptoms may be present. Sensory examination is typically abnormal. Careful clinical examination typically differentiates LES from inflammatory neuropathy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nerve conduction studies confirm a peripheral neuropathic process.Absence of voltage-gated calcium-channel (VGCC) antibodies.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Can be difficult to differentiate because of similar clinical characteristics.In GBS, patients may have a hx of influenza-like or respiratory illness or gastroenteritis before onset of neurological symptoms; no prior hx of malignancy or auto-immune disease.Classic presentation is a progressive symmetrical muscle weakness affecting lower extremities before upper extremities, and proximal muscles before distal muscles, accompanied by paraesthesias in the feet and hands.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nerve conduction studies show a patchy demyelination, slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities, prolonged distal and F-wave latencies, and dispersed response.Absence of VGCC antibodies.Presence of subtype-specific antiganglioside antibodies.</p>",
