"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be seen in infants of any gestational age. Hx of maternal diabetes may be present. Most infants of diabetic mothers are macrosomic. Tachypnoea is the main feature with no hypoxia or cyanosis. Hx of meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) may or may not be present.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CXR is the most important distinguishing test. Findings include perihilar markings and presence of fluid in the transverse fissure on the right side (sail sign). Absence of atelectasis.Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement shows no evidence of hypoxaemia or acidosis.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Respiratory distress secondary to surfactant deficiency is more common in preterm and late preterm infants. A variant of surfactant protein B deficiency may be present as severe respiratory distress in late preterm and term infants, leading to typical clinical presentation of respiratory distress syndrome/hyaline membrane disease; absence of hx of MSAF.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Demonstration of absence of surfactant protein B deficiency by molecular testing.ABG measurement shows severe hypoxaemia and acidosis.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be present in association with MAS. Persistent hypoxaemia is present despite maximum ventilator support.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Pulse oximetry demonstrates differential oxygenation between preductal and postductal sites with low oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry. A difference of &gt;5% to 10% in saturation indicates right-to-left shunt through the ductus arteriosus. However, when the saturation is below normal in both sites, absence of difference does not rule out persistent pulmonary hypertension.A difference in PaO2 of 20 mmHg also indicates presence of right-to-left shunt.CXR may show no severe parenchymal disease.Echocardiography reveals tricuspid regurgitation, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and right-to-left shunt through patent ductus arteriosus and patent foramen ovale.</p>",
