"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Difficult to differentiate clinically.The defect may be central (low ADH secretion) or renal (low renal response to ADH). [35]  [39]  Hence, before a water restriction test, central diabetes insipidus (DI) and PPD can seem similar (low ADH and dilute urine). Concomitant PPD and DI have been reported. [40]Central DI may be congenital or acquired and may be associated with other pituitary hormone abnormalities.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Serum sodium is elevated.DI is also associated with low urine concentration before a water restriction test, as with PPD. ADH concentration depends on whether the defect is central DI (low ADH secretion) or renal DI (low renal response to ADH). [35]  [39]Inability to concentrate urine presents following a water deprivation test in both central and renal DI.Adequate urine concentration achieved following vasopressin administration in central DI.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Thiazide diuretics are the most common cause of hypovolaemic or euvolaemic hyponatraemia. [44]Mechanisms include potassium loss, which contributes to a sodium shift to the intracellular compartment, and volume loss, which stimulates ADH secretion, thereby promoting water retention.Loop diuretics are less likely to cause hyponatraemia. A possible reason is that they wash out solute from the renal medulla, which reduces interstitial osmolality and the driving force for water reabsorption from the tubule.",
