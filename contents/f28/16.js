"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Anyone who travels to high altitude, whether a recreational hiker, professional mountain climber, or rescue worker, is at risk of developing high altitude illness. High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening form of such illness.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention of HAPE are reviewed here. Other forms of high altitude illness are discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?1/6/1130?source=see_link\">",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATHOPHYSIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is the abnormal accumulation of water in the lung due to a breakdown in the pulmonary blood-gas barrier, triggered by hypobaric hypoxia. This breakdown develops from a number of maladaptive responses to hypoxia, including poor ventilatory response, increased sympathetic tone, exaggerated and uneven pulmonary vasoconstriction (pulmonary hypertension), inadequate production of endothelial nitric oxide, and overproduction of endothelin [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The end result is a patchy accumulation of extravascular fluid in the alveolar spaces that impairs respiration and can, in severe cases, prove fatal.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Genetics likely play an important role in the risk of HAPE, as suggested by the marked variability in individual susceptibility and the higher rates of recurrence among some individuals [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    High mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, in excess of 35 to 40 mmHg, appears to be the initiating event. Specific segmental and subsegmental capillary beds with relatively less vasoconstriction are disproportionately exposed to elevated microvascular pressures (&gt;20 mmHg) that arise from the elevated mean PA pressure. This uneven vasoconstriction and regional overperfusion result in failure of the alveolar-capillary barrier and patchy pulmonary edema.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    As disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier progresses, high molecular weight proteins, cells, and fluid leak into the alveolar space. Eventually, basement endothelial and epithelial cell membranes are disrupted, leading to alveolar hemorrhage.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A striking feature of HAPE is the rapid reversibility of this process with descent or the administration of oxygen. Pulmonary vascular resistance returns to normal within days after descent to low altitude.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;HAPE generally occurs above 2500 m (8000 ft) (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999 \" href=\"UTD.htm?8/24/8588\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    and",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199 \" href=\"UTD.htm?0/4/71\">",
"     table 2",
"    </a>",
"    ). The risk depends upon individual susceptibility, altitude attained, rate of ascent, and time spent at altitude. At approximately 4500 m (14,800 ft) the incidence of HAPE ranges from 0.2 to 6 percent, depending upon the rate of ascent. At 5500 m the incidence ranges between 2 and 15 percent, again depending upon rate of ascent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/2,4,5\">",
"     2,4,5",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) develop in a high percentage of those with HAPE [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/6,7\">",
"     6,7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. HAPE and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) may also occur concomitantly. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?1/6/1130?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Factors associated with an increased incidence of HAPE include male gender, cold ambient temperatures, preexisting respiratory infection, and vigorous exertion [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Preexisting conditions or anatomic abnormalities that lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, or increased pulmonary vascular reactivity may predispose to HAPE, even at altitudes below 2500 m. These include primary pulmonary hypertension, congenital absence of one pulmonary artery, and left-to-right intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A patent foramen ovale (PFO), in the setting of rising pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), may reverse the direction of blood flow, shunting blood from right to left and further exacerbating hypoxemia. PFO is four times more common among HAPE-susceptible individuals. Larger PFOs correlate directly with increased arterial hypoxemia, and a trend toward an increased risk of developing HAPE [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Whether PFO contributes to HAPE or is merely a marker of increased vascular reactivity and susceptibility remains unknown.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DIAGNOSIS",
"    </span>",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Clinical presentation",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;HAPE generally begins with a subtle, nonproductive cough, mild shortness of breath, and difficulty walking uphill [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Such nonspecific symptoms are easily mistaken for a benign upper respiratory tract infection or attributed to normal breathlessness at altitude or exhaustion. Initial symptoms typically appear two to four days after arrival at a new altitude. Occasionally, HAPE develops precipitously. This occurs more often at night or after severe exertion. It almost never develops after a week at the same altitude.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    As HAPE progresses, dyspnea becomes noticeable at rest and severe with any attempt at exertion. Even walking on a level surface becomes an effort. A cardinal clinical feature of HAPE is the early progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest. In about 50 percent of cases, HAPE is accompanied by acute mountain sickness [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?1/6/1130?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    As symptoms progress, the cough can become productive of pink, frothy sputum and may produce frank blood [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Severely restricted exercise tolerance becomes debilitating and severe hypoxemia may become life-threatening without prompt descent or supplemental oxygen. Severe hypoxemia may cause drowsiness or concomitant high altitude cerebral edema [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    On physical examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade fever (up to 38&ordm;C) are common. Inspiratory crackles may be more prominent in the right middle lobe initially, but become bilateral and diffuse as HAPE progresses. Auscultation of the right middle lobe is best performed at the mid-lateral chest wall. Pulse oximetry reveals saturation values at least 10 points lower than expected for the altitude, and may be as low as 40 to 50 percent. Typically, the patient appears better than expected for the severity of hypoxemia.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Presentation in children",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In children, HAPE presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days, but may develop more precipitously. Young children and infants may manifest only pallor and depressed consciousness or other nonspecific symptoms such as increased fussiness, crying, decreased appetite, decreased playfulness, disrupted sleep, and possibly vomiting [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/10-13\">",
"     10-13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In infants, increased pulmonary artery pressure and fetal shunting, with or without HAPE, can cause severe hypoxemia. (See",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"     'Pathophysiology'",
"    </a>",
"    above.)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Of note, HAPE alone does not cause an elevation in body temperature over 38&ordm;C, and young children with a higher fever should be assessed in standard fashion. However, respiratory infection and HAPE can coexist. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/14/22762?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The differential diagnosis in children includes pneumonia, undetected intracardiac shunts, and in infants opening of fetal shunts in response to high altitude pulmonary hypertension. (See",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Diagnostic studies and tests",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;As with AMS and HACE, the diagnosis of HAPE is based upon the history and physical examination. However, chest radiography is useful and reveals characteristic patchy alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right central hemithorax, which become more confluent and bilateral as the illness progresses (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80267 \" href=\"UTD.htm?2/21/2384\">",
"     image 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). In a few cases, HAPE may not take this classic radiographic appearance [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/16/28936/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although the radiographic appearance of HAPE may mimic that of infectious infiltrates, we often find a significant discrepancy between the extensive infiltrates on x-ray and the clinical status of the patient, who often does not appear severely ill and steadily improves with oxygen therapy. In contrast, a patient with a comparable chest x-ray due to pneumonia would appear critically ill and likely require intubation and mechanical ventilation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest reveals findings similar to those of plain x-ray (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67452 \" href=\"UTD.htm?26/50/27428\">",
"     image 2",
"    </a>",
"    ). Echocardiography reveals increased pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and sometimes right heart dysfunction and paradoxical septal motion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In HAPE, the white blood cell count is typically elevated but brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is typically not. An elevated BNP suggests a diagnosis other than isolated HAPE (eg, acute decompensated heart failure). The results of other readily available tests are nonspecific and unhelpful in diagnosing HAPE. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?19/30/19945?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H16#H16\">",

"     Differential diagnosis",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pneumonia heads the list of differential diagnoses, but pulmonary embolism, acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), acute coronary syndrome, bronchitis, and reactive airway disease are also included. Of note, HAPE and infection can coexist. (See",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Differentiating HAPE from such ailments as ADHF or pneumonia can be difficult, particularly in older patients with comorbid conditions. In such patients, HAPE is a diagnosis of exclusion and alternative diagnoses should be worked up in standard fashion. HAPE is associated with marked weakness and often severe hypoxemia (SpO2 of 50 to 75 percent; PaO2 of 25 to 40 mmHg). While ill-appearing, patients with HAPE generally look better than would be expected given their hypoxemia and rapidly improve with supplemental oxygen therapy.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    More commonly, the diagnosis of HAPE is entertained in otherwise healthy patients with a characteristic history and examination findings. Rapid response over hours to oxygen therapy strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE in this setting. In contrast, symptoms and signs of pneumonia require several days before clinical improvement. Rapid improvement with descent is another important diagnostic clue to the diagnosis of HAPE.",

"    ]. Unlike high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), immediate descent is not mandatory in all treatment settings. Instead, treatment of HAPE varies depending upon a number of factors, including severity of illness, available treatments, setting, clinician experience, and patient preference. As examples, management of a resort skier at 2500 m may consist solely of supplemental oxygen and rest, while management of a mountaineer camping in a remote location at 5500 m and without access to supplemental oxygen requires descent.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The key principle in successful treatment of HAPE, regardless of the setting or patient age, is prompt reduction of pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. Means to achieve this end include limiting physical exertion and cold exposure, providing supplemental oxygen via tank or concentrator, evacuation to a lower altitude, simulating descent using hyperbaric therapy, and giving appropriate medications. Descent (simulated or actual) and supplemental oxygen are often effective alone and appear to be superior to any pharmacologic therapy.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    No trials have been performed in patients with HAPE that directly compare treatment using oxygen and descent with pharmacologic therapy. Nevertheless, the clinical outcomes reported in studies in which",

"    In the field, oxygen may be limited, precluding its use as the sole treatment. Supplemental oxygen can be combined with descent (or hyperbaric therapy) and medication in such cases. However, while some studies have shown that oxygen combined with medication is more effective than oxygen alone in lowering PA pressure, clinical outcomes were not assessed [",

"    with the SpO2 maintained at 90 percent or higher. If the patient is clinically improved and appropriate for outpatient therapy, he or she may be sent home with an oxygen concentrator to be used continuously and strict instructions to rest. The patient's condition and SpO2 are rechecked daily until an ambulatory SpO2, measured while the patient breathes room air, is &ge;90 percent.

Ideally, immediate evacuation is undertaken to a hospital below 3000 m that is capable of providing high-flow oxygen.",

"    Nevertheless, in practice, scores of HAPE patients are treated successfully in remote clinics or base camps with modest descent and rest, sometimes in combination with hyperbaric therapy, low-flow supplemental oxygen, and medication. Many remote clinics are located only 500 to 1000 m below the elevation of HAPE onset. When HAPE is diagnosed early and treated in the manner described, many climbers go on to reascend slowly after two to three days of recovery.

"      High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) generally occurs above 2500 m (8000 ft). The incidence depends upon individual susceptibility, altitude attained, rate of ascent, and time spent at altitude. Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) develop in approximately 50 percent of those with HAPE. High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) may also occur concomitantly. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Pathophysiology'",
"      </a>",
"      above and",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Epidemiology and risk factors'",
"      </a>",
"      above and",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?1/6/1130?source=see_link\">",
"       \"Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema\"",
"      </a>",
"      .)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Preexisting conditions or anatomic abnormalities that lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, or increased pulmonary vascular reactivity may predispose to HAPE, even at altitudes below 2500 m. Such conditions include primary pulmonary hypertension and left-to-right intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects. Additional risk factors are described in the text. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Epidemiology and risk factors'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      HAPE generally begins with a subtle, nonproductive cough, mild shortness of breath, and difficulty walking uphill. Symptoms typically appear two to four days after arrival at higher altitude. As HAPE progresses, dyspnea becomes noticeable at rest and severe with any attempt at exertion. On physical examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade fever are common. A cardinal clinical feature of HAPE is the rapid progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest. Oxygen saturation values are at least 10 points below normal for altitude, and usually range from 50 to 75 percent. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Clinical presentation'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      In children, HAPE presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days, but may develop more precipitously. Young children and infants may manifest only pallor and depressed consciousness or other nonspecific symptoms. It can be difficult to differentiate between HAPE and viral respiratory infection, and the two may coexist. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"       'Presentation in children'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Chest radiography usually reveals characteristic patchy alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right central hemithorax, which become more confluent and bilateral as the illness progresses. A significant discrepancy often exists between the extensive infiltrates on x-ray and the clinical status of the patient, who often does not appear severely ill and steadily improves with oxygen therapy. Other commonly available tests are nonspecific. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H7\">",
"       'Diagnostic studies and tests'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Differentiating HAPE from such ailments as acute decompensated heart failure or pneumonia can be difficult, particularly in older patients with comorbid conditions. In such patients, HAPE is a diagnosis of exclusion. In general, HAPE is associated with marked weakness and hypoxemia is more severe than that associated with most cases of pneumonia. Rapid response over hours to oxygen therapy strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H8\">",
"       'Differential diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Early recognition of HAPE and prompt intervention are critical to assuring a favorable outcome. Immediate descent is not mandatory in all cases; treatment varies depending upon the severity of illness, available treatments, setting, and clinician experience. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"       'Treatment'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Supplemental oxygen is first-line therapy for HAPE and should be provided in ALL treatment settings when available. Oxygen and descent (simulated or actual) are often effective alone and appear to be superior to any pharmacologic therapy. In the hospital setting, supplemental oxygen and rest are generally sufficient treatment. In remote high-altitude settings, descent should begin as soon as HAPE is suspected. Adjunctive medical therapies may be helpful and are discussed in the text. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"       'Treatment'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      For patients with no history of medical problems at high altitude, the risk of HAPE is low and routine prophylaxis is not warranted. We suggest prophylaxis with",
"      <a class=\"drug drug_general\" href=\"UTD.htm?12/5/12377?source=see_link\">",
"       nifedipine",
"      </a>",
"      for individuals with a history of HAPE or with known predisposing factors who must ascend to altitudes above 2500 m without adequate time for acclimatization (",
"      <a class=\"grade\" href=\"._grade_5?title=Grade 2B\">",
"       Grade 2B",
"      </a>",
"      ). In such circumstances, we give nifedipine 30 mg of a slow release formulation every 12 hours. Additional adjunct medications for prophylaxis are discussed in the text. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H22\">",
"       'Prevention'",

The emergency clinician must work through a wide differential diagnosis while providing appropriate initial treatment for a potentially life-threatening illness. Airway, breathing, and circulation are the emergency clinician's primary focus when beginning management of the acutely dyspneic patient. Once these are stabilized, further clinical investigation and treatment can proceed.",

For hypoxic patients with respiratory difficulty, 50 to 60 LPM of oxygen should be provided via a nonrebreather mask. To deliver this much oxygen, open the flow meter valve until the indicator lies well beyond the 15 LPM mark.",

"    Patients breathing 100 percent oxygen deliver five times as much oxygen to the alveoli per unit of ventilation as those breathing room air and in the absence of parenchymal disease can maintain a normal SpO2 with only two or three breaths per minute. Note, however, that the best nonrebreather oxygen delivery systems provide only 85 percent oxygen.",

The target oxygen saturation in such patients is 90 to 94 percent with the understanding that this may result in hypercarbia and reduce ventilatory drive. However, failure to oxygenate the patient may have profoundly adverse consequences. If a clinician determines that a COPD patient requires endotracheal intubation, oxygen delivery should be maximized without regard for the target oxygen saturation or hypercarbia. (See",

"    While oxygen is provided and initial interventions (eg, IV access) are made, the clinician determines the need for airway management and ventilatory support. For patients that require ventilatory assistance to overcome an infraglottic challenge (eg, bronchospasm or parenchymal disease) or nonpulmonary disease (eg, neuromuscular disease), both noninvasive and invasive strategies exist. Noninvasive ventilation with a mask delivering continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BLPAP) can increase minute ventilation, reduce the work of breathing, recruit alveoli, and improve hemodynamics. Noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) or a COPD exacerbation. (See",

"    Noninvasive ventilation does NOT improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and diseases that do not respond rapidly to medical therapy (eg, pneumonia and ARDS). In such instances, endotracheal intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation should be pursued aggressively when ventilatory support is needed. (See",

"    An electrocardiogram (ECG) and stat portable chest x-ray (CXR) should be obtained early in the course of management when appropriate. The ECG may reveal signs of cardiac ischemia, such as ST segment deviations or inverted T waves. Findings of right heart strain (eg, inverted T waves in the right precordial or inferior leads, complete or incomplete right bundle branch block, right axis deviation) are consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE). Diffuse low voltage or electrical alternans in a patient with dyspnea and hypotension suggests pericardial tamponade. (See",

"    A portable CXR may reveal cardiomegaly and other signs of pulmonary edema, a pneumothorax, hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms suggestive of COPD, or an infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. Nevertheless, many life-threatening causes of dyspnea may not manifest any abnormality on CXR. Bedside ultrasound can be useful in making the diagnosis of pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade. (See",

"   <p>",
"    Clinicians should take care not to confuse pneumonia and ADHF, which can have a similar appearance on CXR and sound similar with auscultation. Blood pressure, treatment response, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can help to distinguish the two. Pneumonia is more often associated with a normal or low blood pressure, does not respond to early therapy, and is generally NOT associated with a rise in BNP. ADHF is generally associated with a high blood pressure, often responds to aggressive early therapy, and is associated with a rise in BNP. (See",

"    The diagnosis of PE can be difficult to make. Although most patients with dyspnea secondary to a PE demonstrate some abnormality on CXR or ECG, there are no pathognomonic findings in either test. A definitive diagnosis is made based upon imaging with a multidetector CT or ventilation perfusion scan.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although obvious causes of dyspnea are treated as they are identified, in some instances the cause of dyspnea is not immediately apparent. In such cases, the ED clinician must intervene with treatments or by obtaining emergent consultation based upon the clinical context and available data. As examples, such interventions may include broad spectrum antibiotics when infection is suspected or stress dose glucocorticoids for patients who use such medications chronically.",

"   <p>",
"    When managing a life-threatening complaint with a broad differential diagnosis such as severe, acute dyspnea, it is crucial that emergency clinicians not fall prey to premature diagnostic closure.

Patients being discharged must have a clear understanding of their discharge diagnosis, written discharge instructions, and planned follow-up with clear instructions to return to the ED if their condition worsens. Particularly with elderly patients, the clinician must consider such factors as the patient's living situation and access to medical follow-up when determining the appropriateness of discharge.",

"    Depiction of the optimal endoscopic surveillance intervals in patients with Barrett's esophagus according to the annual incidence of esophageal cancer. More frequent surveillance is associated with increased quality-adjusted life expectancy as the incidence of esophageal cancer increases. In populations with a low incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (less than 0.2 percent), not performing surveillance endoscopy produced the optimal quality-adjusted life expectancy. In contrast, annual surveillance (gray area) was optimal in populations with a high incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (more than 2 percent). These data were derived from a decision analysis using a Markov model.",
