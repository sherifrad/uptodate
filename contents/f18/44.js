"     Fire ants were accidentally imported into Mobile, Alabama in the 1930s from South America. Since then, their range in the United States has expanded throughout the southeastern, southern, and southwestern US, California, and into Puerto Rico. Regularly updated maps of their range and agricultural quarantine areas in the US are available at",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Fire ants have a major impact because they prey on other insects and animals, sting humans and farm animals, and form large mounds of soil that damage farm machines and crops [",

"      WHAT ARE FIRE ANTS?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Fire ants are aggressive, venomous insects that have become a serious problem in many areas of the United States and around the world. The ants range in size; queens are often three-fourths of an inch long, while minor workers are approximately one-eighth inch.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The ants build dome-shaped nests (mounds) of soil that are 2.5 to 3 feet across. These tend to be flatter when built in sand. The queens are underground, protected by many workers, and continuously lay eggs to produce new ants. During dry or cold conditions, ant colonies move deeper into the mound or under paved areas and even into buildings. Mature colonies can contain as many as 100,000 to 500,000 worker ants.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The ants have pinching mandibles on the head and a sharp stinger on the rear of the body, which is connected to a large, internal venom sac. When attacking predators or disturbed by an object, the ant grasps the object with the mandibles, quickly inserts the stinger, and injects venom.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Once attached to the skin, fire ants continue to sting an average of three times before removal. Most stings occur on the feet or legs after stepping on a fire ant mound. Stings are largest and most painful during the summer, when the ants have the largest quantity of venom. Up to 50 percent of people who live in an area of fire ant infestation are stung per year.",

"      REACTIONS TO FIRE ANT STINGS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     There are three main types of reactions to fire ant stings.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Local reaction &mdash; The most common reaction to fire ant stings is immediate intense burning, followed by itching, redness, and a 12 to 20 cm (5 to 9 inches) raised red welt on the skin at the sting site [",
"       <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19138/abstract/1\">",
"        1",
"       </a>",
"       ]. These symptoms usually resolve over four to six hours. The next day, there is usually a sterile pustule at the sting site, which is best described as a small bump with a white blister on top. The pustule resolves over a week or so unless it is scratched off. Scratching is not recommended because it can allow an infection to develop in the skin.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Large local reaction &mdash; A small percentage of people who are stung develop a large local reaction. Signs include extreme itching and a large raised red welt at the site of the sting. Over 6 to 12 hours, the swelling and intense itching increases and evolves into a large area of painful swelling. These reactions reach maximum size at 24 to 48 hours, when they are hot, itchy, and painful.",
"       <br/>",
"       <br/>",
"       Rarely, swelling can be large enough to interrupt the blood supply to toes or fingers. Fortunately, large local reactions do not cause a bodywide allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Anaphylaxis &mdash; Between 0.6 and 16 percent of people who are stung by a fire ant have a severe, whole-body allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This type of reaction is more common in people who have previously been stung or had an allergic reaction to a wasp (yellow jacket) sting. Anaphylactic reactions are very serious, and usually develop within 30 minutes of being stung. If left untreated, this reaction can be life-threatening. Signs of anaphylaxis include bodywide itching, welts, difficulty breathing or swallowing, weakness, or fainting. (See",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The chemical insecticides used today are only effective for short-term control (3 to 12 months), must be reapplied periodically, and are costly. They can be used effectively to control infestations [",

"      3",
"     </a>",
"     ]. The oil containing the insecticide is then absorbed into a carrier (such as corn grits), which is dispersed over an area. This is considered the most effective and efficient method to control multiple colonies over a large area. Regular applications should be made in the spring and fall to control ants that move in from untreated areas.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Insecticides used in baits are usually slow acting so that the foraging worker ant can pick up the bait, extract the toxic oil, and feed it to the queen and other ants before dying. Depending upon the active ingredient, the queen either dies, becomes infertile, or does not produce mature ants, leading to the eventual death of the colony. There are now fast-acting baits that cause colony death in three days or less (compared to older baits that take two weeks or longer).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Broadcast bait applications eliminate the need to locate individual ant mounds, but instead depend upon foraging ants to take the bait back to the rest of the colony. In addition, the colony will generally not simply relocate because the mound is not disturbed and the queen is eliminated. Because large areas can be treated, this method can result in slower reinfestation by colonies migrating from other, untreated areas.",

"    <p>",
"     Ideally, contact insecticides should kill worker ants quickly because slower-acting chemicals may allow the ants to relocate.",
"    </p>",

"      Combination treatments",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Many experts prefer the use of a combination of treatments to kill fire ants. Broadcast baiting can be combined with individual mound treatments. Baits should always be broadcast first to efficiently reduce fire ant populations. After one or two days, the worker ants have spread the bait through the colony, which can then be treated with an individual contact insecticide to quickly eliminate the worker ants, which can sting.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Central apneas are periods of absent airflow due to lack of respiratory effort. They occur when inhibitory input to the respiratory center of the brain exceeds excitatory input, which may occur during sleep because sleep abolishes wakefulness-related excitatory input. Recurrent central apneas are the hallmark feature of central sleep apnea (CSA).",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Respiration during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is critically dependent on chemical influences, especially arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). Central apnea results if arterial PaCO2 is lowered below a highly sensitive \"apneic threshold\" (",

"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      First, any of a variety of stimuli induce hyperpnea. As an example, hypoxia (eg, due to secretions or decreased lung volumes) is a common trigger of hyperpnea during sleep [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/2-5\">",

"      </a>",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The hyperpnea causes ventilatory overshoot and hypocapnia, which induces a central apnea.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The central apnea causes the PaCO2 to rise. Mild hypercapnia (4 to 6 mmHg above eucapnia) restores rhythmic respiration, with or without an arousal [",

"      ].",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Hypocapnia is not an omnipotent mechanism of reduced ventilation during NREM sleep. In fact, transient hyperpnea occurs in most individuals during sleep, but relatively few develop central apneas. In healthy individuals, the hyperpnea elicits a neurologic phenomenon referred to as short-term potentiation (STP). STP delays and mitigates the magnitude of the ventilatory decline that follows the stimulus [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/3,4,11,12\">",
"     3,4,11,12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In patients who manifest central apneas, prolonged hyperventilation, prolonged hypoxia, or concomitant inhibitory factors offset the effects of STP and allow central apnea to occur when the PaCO2 is reduced below the apneic threshold [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/13-16\">",
"     13-16",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The sequence of events that cause a central apnea are cyclic, which explains why central apneas are usually recurrent, rather than isolated events. Upper airway reflexes may accentuate the cycle described above. During a central apnea, the pharyngeal airway narrows and may occlude [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/17\">",
"     17",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Resumption of breathing requires that tissue adhesion forces and cranio-facial gravitational forces be overcome, which requires that greater negative airway pressure be produced [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/18\">",
"     18",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Upper airway deformation caused by negative airway pressure has been shown to induce central apnea in animal models [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/19\">",
"     19",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Whether this mechanism contributes to central apnea in humans is uncertain. Supporting the possibility that it does contribute, central apneas are more common in the supine position (upper airway narrowing and occlusion tend to be greatest in this position), may be reduced or eliminated by moving into the lateral position (upper airway narrowing and occlusion tend to be less in this position), and may be prevented with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [",

"     CENTRAL APNEA DUE TO HYPOVENTILATION",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hypoventilation is a less common cause of central apnea. It usually occurs in patients who have a marginal ventilatory status due to a central nervous system disease (eg, encephalitis), a neuromuscular disease (eg, post-polio syndrome), or severe abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics (eg, kyphoscoliosis) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/24\">",
"     24",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Rarely, patients may have primary alveolar hypoventilation, characterized by blunted chemoreceptor responsiveness [",

"   <p>",
"    During sleep, the wakefulness stimulus to breathe disappears, resulting in alveolar hypoventilation and central apneas. Ventilation is restored during arousal from sleep, but declines when sleep resumes. In this setting, the central apnea may not meet strict criteria for being \"central\" or for being an \"apnea\":",

"      With respect to an event being central, it may be difficult to distinguish absent respiratory effort due to lack of ventilatory output from the brain, from markedly decreased respiratory effort due to respiratory muscle disease or skeletal deformities.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      With respect to an event being an apnea, it may be difficult to distinguish an apnea from severe alveolar hypoventilation, making measurement of the duration of the event imprecise. A certain duration of absent airflow is required to define an apnea. (See",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?14/59/15286?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H5#H5\">",

"     CENTRAL APNEA AT SLEEP ONSET",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Central apneas may also occur in healthy individuals during transition from wakefulness to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This phenomenon is called sleep state oscillation and its mechanism is similar to that of hyperventilation-induced central apneas.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    During the transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep, PaCO2 is at or below the apneic threshold [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/2,29-31\">",
"     2,29-31",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Once NREM sleep begins, wakefulness-related excitatory input is lost and a central apnea results. The central apnea causes the PaCO2 to rise and stimulate transient wakefulness. Hyperventilation ensues, returning the PaCO2 to a level at or below the apneic threshold. A central apnea can recur when sleep resumes, allowing the above sequence of events to repeat. PaCO2 stabilizes above the apneic threshold once the transition from wakefulness to sleep is complete, thereby terminating the cycle.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In comparison, central apneas are uncommon during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This is probably due to increased ventilatory output from the brain, compared to NREM sleep [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19140/abstract/32,33\">",
"     32,33",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, a marked reduction of alveolar ventilation due to loss of intercostal and accessory muscle activity can occur during REM sleep, which may be difficult to distinguish from a central apnea. This is particularly true among patients with poor lung function or neuromuscular disease (eg, severe diaphragm dysfunction).",

This triggers a cyclic sequence of events, including ventilatory overshoot, hypocapnia, central apnea, hypercapnia, recurrent hyperpnea, and so on. Central apneas occur when the PaCO2 falls below an \"apneic threshold\". (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",

"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Most patients with hypoventilation-induced central apneas have a marginal ventilatory status due to a central nervous system disease, a neuromuscular disease, or severe abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics. During sleep, the wakefulness stimulus to breathe disappears, resulting in alveolar hypoventilation and central apnea. Ventilation is restored during arousal from sleep, but declines when sleep resumes, resulting in cyclic hypoventilation. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Central apnea due to hypoventilation'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Central apneas may also occur in healthy individuals at sleep onset as sleep state oscillates between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The mechanism is similar to that of hyperventilation-induced central apneas. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Trigger finger (also called stenosing flexor tenosynovitis) is noninfectious inflammation of the flexor tendon sheath of the finger (or thumb). The flexor tendons for each digit travel in a fibro-osseous tunnel between the metacarpal and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint; the superficialis tendon attaches to the middle phalanges and the profundus tendon to the distal phalanges. The tunnel provides nutrition to the tendon as well as mechanical stability. Irritation or inflammation of the fibro-osseous tunnel can occur as the result of repetitive use.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",

"     MECHANISM OF ACTION",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The mode of action of INH is complex. The best-defined mechanism is inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis. However, INH also disrupts DNA, lipid, carbohydrate, and NAD synthesis",

"    However, some low-level INH-resistant clinical isolates do not have mutations in these genes, indicating that additional, unknown genes may be involved in INH resistance. (See",

"   <p>",
"    A survey conducted in 58 different countries from 1996 to 1999 by the World Health Organization found a worldwide prevalence of INH resistance among new cases of tuberculosis of 10.6 percent; the prevalence in the United States was 8 percent [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    As with other antituberculous agents, resistance is higher in certain patient populations in the United States (African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Indochinese refugees). In 2005, the CDC reported primary INH resistance in 9.8 percent of isolates from foreign-born subjects, and approximately 4.1 percent in United States-born patients [",

"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. INH resistance is also higher among patients with a previous history of tuberculosis. Among United States-born persons without a previous history of tuberculosis, resistance to INH was 4.1 percent in 2005 compared to 9.1 percent in patients with a prior history of tuberculosis. Primary resistance is also more prevalent in developing countries of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;All of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may induce a dry, persistent, and often nocturnal cough (in 5 to 20 percent of patients). The cough may develop within hours of the first dose or weeks to months later. It is more common in women, non-smokers, and persons of Chinese origin. The cough typically resolves 1 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor but in a subgroup of coughers, resolution may take several months [",

"    ]. One important caveat is that cough may be a symptom of heart failure, and a thorough history and examination is needed to ascertain whether the cough is truly related to the ACE inhibitor therapy. An increased incidence of cough does not appear to occur with the angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as",

"    Angioedema may rarely be associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Since ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema typically causes swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, larynx, pharynx, and subglottic tissues, upper airway compromise may be the presenting sign. Unlike classical hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor level and function and thus the C4 levels are normal in ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Home hemodialysis began in the early 1960s in Boston, Seattle, and London [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/1-5\">",
"     1-5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Studies since then have shown that patients using conventional, three times weekly home hemodialysis have an increased survival [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/6-13\">",
"     6-13",

"     14-16",
"    </a>",
"    ] compared to those who use other dialysis modalities. This modality also costs significantly less than conventional in-center hemodialysis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/17-21\">",
"     17-21",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These findings led some investigators to believe that home hemodialysis is the best renal replacement therapy other than renal transplantation. Despite these apparent benefits, the proportion of prevalent dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated by home hemodialysis in the United States declined steadily from the start of the Medicare ESRD program in 1973 until 2002 when it was 0.57 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/22\">",
"     22",

"     23-25",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Since 2002, there has been a gradual increase in the number and percent of all United States dialysis patients treated by home hemodialysis; by 2008, there were 3826 patients (1.09 percent) on home hemodialysis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/22\">",
"     22",
"    </a>",
"    ], and preliminary estimates for 2010 suggest the number of patients is now between 5000 and 6000. This reflects the increasing interest in more frequent home hemodialysis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/26\">",
"     26",
"    </a>",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Issues relating to patient survival and other benefits derived from home hemodialysis, the declining incidence of this modality in the United States, and developments with more frequent daily and nightly hemodialysis (which are generally performed at home at night) are discussed here and elsewhere [",

"     INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The absolute number and relative percentage of dialysis patients who use home hemodialysis in the United States declined from 40 percent in 1971 to 0.57 percent in 2002. According to the 2010 United States Renal Data System Report, only 520 (0.51 percent) of all incident dialysis patients and 3826 (1.09 percent) of all prevalent dialysis patients were treated by home hemodialysis in 2008 [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Internationally, there is little or no home hemodialysis except in a number of high income countries with an annual per capita gross national income greater than US $10,000, and until recently the number of home dialysis patients had been declining in most of these countries [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/25\">",
"     25",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The prevalence of home hemodialysis in 2001 to 2003 varied from zero per million population (pmp) in Portugal to 58.4 pmp in New Zealand, and country to country variation was more than that of any other modality of ESRD treatment. In the United States in 2002, the home hemodialysis rate was 6.1 pmp and in 2008 had doubled to 12.3 pmp.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Home hemodialysis prevalence is positively associated with the prevalence of peritoneal dialysis but not with the median age of the ESRD population. There is no correlation with the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy, national healthcare expenditures, or population density. In the United States, a study using 2007 ESRD Network data and Medicare&rsquo;s Dialysis Facility Compare file examined facility and patient characteristics related to use of home hemodialysis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/29\">",
"     29",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This showed a positive association between home hemodialysis and unit size, percent of patients who were employed full or part-time, a younger patient population, and the number of years the facility had been certified by Medicare. Negative associations included a larger number of patients per dialysis station, chain association, rural location, denser general population density in the area, a late dialysis shift, and a greater population of black patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/29\">",
"     29",
"    </a>",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It was noted in 2006 that there was opportunity for significant expansion of the use of home hemodialysis in many countries [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/25\">",
"     25",

This machine is also easy for patients to learn to use. Larger patients may need five or six bags of dialysate to provide adequate dialysis.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;All members of the dialysis team must become advocates for home hemodialysis and for more frequent dialysis when this becomes financially feasible. Until that time, conventional overnight three-times-a-week or alternate-night hemodialysis, either at home or in a center, is an optimal treatment schedule. As of the end of 2007, 841 patients were on conventional home hemodialysis three times a week, 302 were on alternate nights; 2396 were on short daily and 225 were on home hemodialysis five or six nights a week [",

"    Although it may become more difficult to see potential ESRD patients early in the course of renal failure if they are enrolled in managed care programs, nephrologists must impress upon their colleagues that patients with stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease should be referred early to teach them about management of their disease and to introduce them to the benefits of home hemodialysis, more frequent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and transplantation. This knowledge will help reduce patient fear and depression. It will also make it possible for ESRD patients to face their illness realistically and positively, and provide an opportunity for them to select the best available dialysis treatment. A website, Home Dialysis Central (www.homedialysis.org), is an excellent resource for those interested in home dialysis [",

"   <p>",
"    Studies reporting better patient outcomes with home hemodialysis and more frequent hemodialysis highlight the importance of informing patients about the various modalities of dialysis available to them and, in particular, the benefits of home hemodialysis and more frequent hemodialysis. Nephrologists in the United States and Canada believe that home dialysis therapies are underused and that 11 to 14 percent of all dialysis patients could be treated by home hemodialysis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/79\">",
"     79",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A 2007 survey of 6595 delegates at five international dialysis and nephrology conferences (57 percent physicians and 28 percent nurses) found that the majority considered frequent home or self-care hemodialysis the best long-term therapy [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?18/44/19144/abstract/80\">",
"     80",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, at least two informal polls of nephrologists at meetings asking what treatment they would choose for themselves if transplantation was not an option found the vast majority would opt for home hemodialysis, whether they had any home dialysis patients or not. Thus, clinicians and the entire dialysis team should not let their emotions or economic need decide the dialysis modality choice if there is any possibility of the patient choosing home hemodialysis. This treatment is still the best option for many more patients than currently have the opportunity for it.",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Patients using conventional, three times weekly home hemodialysis have an increased survival and better quality of life compared to those who use conventional in-center hemodialysis in the United States. Home hemodialysis also costs significantly less than conventional in-center hemodialysis. Despite these benefits, relatively few patients use home hemodialysis either in the United States or internationally although its use is increasing. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H1\">",
"       'Introduction'",
"      </a>",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The lack of popularity of home hemodialysis is probably due to a combination of various factors such as the large numbers of elderly or seriously ill patients, the rapid increase in the number of outpatient dialysis units, concern that patients should not dialyze without direct supervision by a nurse, lack of satisfactory explanation of advantages and disadvantages of home hemodialysis, lack of patient",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       and/or",
"      </span>",
"      family motivation, patient fears regarding technical aspects, lack of attention given to home hemodialysis by nephrology training programs, lack of interest and experience among practicing nephrologists, and few experienced dialysis programs available to train patients. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Reasons for the decline in home hemodialysis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The development of new technology to make dialysis simpler and safer for patients to perform and a change in reimbursement policy by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to pay for more frequent dialysis may encourage greater use of home dialysis. A number of machines intended particularly for home hemodialysis have been developed or are under development. Each system is generally focused making the procedure easier and safer, including improved computer monitoring, sterilization techniques, and feedback designs. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H7\">",
"       'Possible methods to reverse the decline in home hemodialysis'",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      To increase the proportion of ESRD patients treated by home hemodialysis, nephrologists should identify potential patients early for referral to a home hemodialysis training program and for placement of arteriovenous fistula. Clinicians and staff should devote more time to emphasize the benefits of home hemodialysis. A website, Home Dialysis Central (",

"      Pemphigus is rare. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common form of pemphigus. However, in certain areas, particularly in locations where an endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus occurs, pemphigus foliaceus is more prevalent. (See",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The intraepidermal blistering observed in pemphigus occurs due to an immune response that results in the deposition of autoantibodies against epidermal cell surface antigens within the epithelium of mucous membranes or skin. The mechanism through which acantholysis occurs is not fully understood. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H181679704\">",

"     <li>",
"      The desmoglein compensation theory has been proposed as an explanation for the frequently observed correlation of the clinical presentation of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus with specific circulating autoantibodies (",

"       figure 2",
"      </a>",
"      ). Circulating autoantibodies to desmoglein 1 are associated with cutaneous involvement, whereas circulating autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 have been linked to mucosal disease. Since desmogleins are not the only molecules that contribute to cell adhesion and not all patients exhibit antibody profiles consistent with this theory, it is likely that autoantibodies against other epithelial antigens are involved in these diseases.
