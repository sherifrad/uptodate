"      CONSTIPATION OVERVIEW",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Constipation refers to a change in bowel habits, but it has varied meanings. Stools may be too hard or too small, difficult to pass, or infrequent (less than three times per week). People with constipation may also notice a frequent need to strain and a sense that the bowels are not empty.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Constipation is a very common problem. Each year more than 2.5 million Americans visit their healthcare provider for relief from this problem. Many factors can contribute to or cause constipation, although in most people, no single cause can be found. In general, constipation occurs more frequently as you get older. (See",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?13/22/13673?source=see_link\">",

"      CONSTIPATION DIAGNOSIS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Constipation can usually be diagnosed based upon your symptoms and a physical examination. You should also mention any medications you take regularly since some medications can cause constipation.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     You may need a rectal examination as part of a physical examination. A rectal examination involves inserting a gloved finger inside the rectum to feel for any lumps or abnormalities. This test can also check for blood in the stool.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Further testing may be ordered in some situations, for example, if you have had a recent change in bowel habits, blood in the stool, weight loss, or a family history of colon cancer. Testing may include blood tests, x-rays, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or more specialized testing if needed. (See",

"      When to seek help",

"    <p>",
"     Treatment for constipation includes changing some behaviors, eating foods high in fiber, and using laxatives or enemas if needed.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     You can try these treatments at home, before seeing a healthcare provider. However, if you do not have a bowel movement within a few days, you should call your healthcare provider for further assistance. (See",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?29/57/30616?source=see_link\">",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Behavior changes",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The bowels are most active following meals, and this is often the time when stools will pass most readily. If you ignore your body's signals to have a bowel movement, the signals become weaker and weaker over time.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     By paying close attention to these signals, you may have an easier time moving your bowels. Drinking a caffeine-containing beverage in the morning may also be helpful.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H6\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Increase fiber",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Increasing fiber in your diet may reduce or eliminate constipation. The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 20 to 35 grams of fiber per day. By reading the product information panel on the side of the package, you can determine the number of grams of fiber per serving (",
"     <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51585 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?38/31/39413\">",
"      figure 1",

"      table 1",
"     </a>",
"     ). This is especially true of citrus fruits, prunes, and prune juice. Some breakfast cereals are also an excellent source of dietary fiber. (See",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_patient\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?8/39/8817?source=see_link\">",

"     <span class=\"h3\">",
"      Fiber side effects",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Consuming large amounts of fiber can cause abdominal bloating or gas; this can be minimized by starting with a small amount and slowly increasing until stools become softer and more frequent.",

"      LAXATIVES",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If behavior changes and increasing fiber does not relieve your constipation, you may try taking a laxative. A variety of laxatives are available for treating constipation. The choice between them is based upon how they work, how safe the treatment is, and your healthcare provider's preferences.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     In general, laxatives can be categorized into the following groups:",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Bulk forming laxatives",

"      <li>",
"       Psyllium (Konsyl&reg;; Metamucil&reg;; Perdiem&reg;)",

"       Wheat dextrin (Benefiber&reg;)",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",

"    <p>",
"     You should increase the dose of fiber supplements slowly to prevent gas and cramping, and you should always take the supplement with plenty of fluid.",

"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Sorbitol",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Polyethylene glycol is generally preferred since it does not cause gas or bloating and is available in the United States without a prescription. Lactulose and sorbitol can produce gas and bloating. Sorbitol works as well as lactulose and is much less expensive.",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Saline laxatives",
"     </span>",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Stimulant laxatives",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Some people overuse stimulant laxatives. Taking stimulant laxatives regularly or in large amounts can cause side effects, including low potassium levels. Thus, you should take these drugs carefully if you must use them regularly.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     However, there is no convincing evidence that using stimulant laxatives regularly damages the colon, and they do not increase the risk for colorectal cancer or other tumors.",

"      New treatments",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Pills, suppositories, or enemas?",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Laxatives are available as pills that you take by mouth or as suppositories or enemas that you insert into the rectum. In general, suppositories and enemas work more quickly compared to pills, but many people do not like using them.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Healthcare providers occasionally recommend prepackaged enema kits containing",

"    The visceral pleura (VP) of the sheep, an animal with similar pleural anatomy to humans. The visceral pleura lies between the pleural space (PS) and the alveoli (Alv). It is approximately 20 to 80 &micro;m thick and consists of a single mesothelial layer (M) and a subpleural connective tissue layer. The subpleural connective tissue layer contains both collagen and elastin as well as the bronchial arteries (A, which drain into pulmonary veins) and subpleural lymphatics (which do not connect to the pleural space). The bronchial microvessels and lymphatics are relatively far from the pleural space (20 to 50 &micro;m versus 10 to 12 &micro;m in the parietal pleura).",

Most women with sexual complaints have issues that impact more than one phase of the normal sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm) or may complain of a general decrease in sexual satisfaction. As an example, if a woman complains of decreased libido, a full evaluation may also reveal issues with arousal or pain. We restrict use of pharmacologic therapy to women who meet diagnostic criteria for a sexual disorder, a sexual problem associated with personal distress, and for whom non-pharmacologic interventions have proven ineffective.

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary tumor of the liver, which usually develops in the setting of chronic liver disease, particularly in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?24/38/25194?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The diagnosis of HCC can be difficult and often requires the use of one or more imaging modalities [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Ideally, tumors should be detected when they are approximately 2 cm in size so that all treatment options can be offered. However, HCC is frequently diagnosed late in its course because of the absence of pathognomonic symptoms [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/3,4\">",
"     3,4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. As a result, many patients have untreatable disease when first diagnosed. The median survival following diagnosis is approximately 6 to 20 months [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Large tumor size, vascular invasion, poor functional status, and nodal metastases are all associated with a poor outcome [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/6,7\">",
"     6,7",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic review will discuss the clinical and histologic features of HCC, and the various modalities used to diagnose and stage this aggressive tumor. The controversial topic of screening populations at risk for HCC will also be discussed. An overview of treatment for this tumor is presented separately. (See",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CLINICAL FEATURES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Patients who develop HCC usually have no symptoms other than those related to their chronic liver disease. Suspicion for HCC should be heightened in patients with previously compensated cirrhosis who develop decompensation such as ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, or variceal bleeding. These complications are often associated with extension of the tumor into the hepatic or portal veins or arteriovenous shunting induced by the tumor [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Some patients may have mild to moderate upper abdominal pain, weight loss, early satiety, or a palpable mass in the upper abdomen. These symptoms often indicate an advanced lesion [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Other uncommon presentations include:",

"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Obstructive jaundice caused by invasion of the biliary tree, compression of the intrahepatic duct, or rarely, as a result of hemobilia",

"     <li>",
"      Bone pain or dyspnea due to metastases",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Intraperitoneal bleeding due to tumor rupture. Tumor rupture is often associated with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain with distension, an acute drop in the hematocrit and hypotension, and is most commonly diagnosed by peritoneal lavage and laparotomy. CT scan typically demonstrates a liver mass and free intraperitoneal blood [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/10\">",
"       10",
"      </a>",
"      ]. This is a life-threatening complication, and control of bleeding may require emergent angiography and embolization of the bleeding vessel, or even surgery [",

"       11",

"    The physical findings in most patients with HCC (splenomegaly, ascites, jaundice, or other manifestations of decompensated cirrhosis) reflect the underlying liver disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?34/10/34986/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Hepatomegaly or a bruit heard over the liver are occasionally present.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Laboratory examination is usually nonspecific. The majority of patients who develop HCC have cirrhosis, and may have thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoprothrombinemia. Patients are often mildly anemic and may have electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) associated with defective water handling or with diuretic use. Serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase are often abnormal in a nonspecific pattern [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Patients with HCC occasionally develop a paraneoplastic syndrome that can manifest as hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, or severe watery diarrhea.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Hypoglycemia",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hypoglycemia, which usually occurs in advanced HCC, is thought to result from the tumor's high metabolic needs. The hypoglycemia is typically mild and produces no symptoms; however, more severe reductions in the plasma glucose can occur, resulting in lethargy and confusion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Less than 5 percent of tumors secrete insulin-like growth factor-II, which can cause severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, sometimes early in the course of the disease [",

"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Erythrocytosis",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Erythrocytosis in HCC is probably due to tumor secretion of erythropoietin (EPO) [",

"     17,18",

"     21",

"      Patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually have no symptoms other than those related to their chronic liver disease. Suspicion for HCC should be heightened in patients with previously compensated cirrhosis who develop decompensation such as ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, or variceal bleeding. Some patients may have mild to moderate upper abdominal pain, weight loss, early satiety, or a palpable mass in the upper abdomen, symptoms that often indicate an advanced lesion. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Clinical features'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Patients with HCC occasionally develop a paraneoplastic syndrome that can manifest as hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, or severe watery diarrhea. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Paraneoplastic syndromes'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The physical findings in most patients with HCC (splenomegaly, ascites, jaundice, or other manifestations of decompensated cirrhosis) reflect the underlying liver disease. Hepatomegaly or a bruit heard over the liver are occasionally present. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Clinical features'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Laboratory examination is usually nonspecific. The majority of patients who develop HCC have cirrhosis and may have thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoprothrombinemia. Patients are often mildly anemic and may have electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) associated with defective water handling or with diuretic use. Serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase are often abnormal in a nonspecific pattern. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Clinical features'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The only way to effectively diagnose HCC in a timely fashion is to enter patients who are at high risk for development of this tumor in a regular surveillance program using ultrasound imaging every six months. (See",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?28/6/28778?source=see_link\">",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      In patients who are not in a routine surveillance program, the diagnosis of HCC may be first entertained in a patient with underlying liver disease who develops a rising serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. In such patients, a computed tomographic scan of the liver",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       and/or",
"      </span>",
"      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study is often the initial diagnostic maneuver. In cirrhotic patients, any dominant solid nodule that is not clearly a hemangioma should be considered a HCC unless proven otherwise (",

"       algorithm 1",
"      </a>",
"      ). If the lesion is hypervascular, has increased T2 signal intensity, demonstrates venous invasion, or is associated with an elevated AFP, the diagnosis is almost certain. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      If the initial diagnostic imaging study is not definitive, an alternative imaging technique or follow-up imaging may clarify the diagnosis; dysplastic nodules typically remain stable, while an enlarging dominant lesion more likely represents a HCC. Even stable nodules require close follow-up since livers containing dysplastic nodules are at high risk to develop HCC in the future. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      For non-cirrhotic patients, the diagnosis of HCC should be considered for any hepatic mass that is not clearly a hemangioma or focal nodular hyperplasia, especially if it is hypervascular. In the absence of specific clues to the diagnosis, biopsy may be appropriate. (See",
