"     Tremor is the repetitive, involuntary shaking of a body part, most commonly the hands or head. It can be a disorder in its own right, or it can be a sign of another health problem.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     There are several different types of tremor, all of which fall into one of three main categories:",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Resting tremors",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Resting tremors happen while you are sitting or lying down and relaxed. People who have a resting tremor can usually stop the tremor by deliberately moving the affected body part.",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Postural tremors",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Postural tremors happen when you try to hold a body part still, against the force of gravity. If you have a postural tremor, your arms might shake if you hold them out in front of you.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H4\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Action tremors",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Action tremors happen when you move deliberately.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Learning whether you have a resting, postural, or action tremor is the first step in discovering the cause of your tremor and its potential treatment. The different categories of tremor usually have very different causes.",

"    <p>",
"     In a few instances, people with Parkinson disease who have a resting tremor also have an action tremor. A detailed discussion of the treatment options for Parkinson disease appears elsewhere. (See",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Everyone, even people who are healthy, has a little bit of shaking of the hands, especially when performing precise tasks, like threading a needle or focusing a camera. This type of shaking, known as physiologic tremor, is not usually noticeable because it is so mild that it is not visible under normal circumstances.",

"      Essential tremor",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Essential tremor is the term healthcare providers use to describe tremors that do not seem to be physiologic (see above) or linked to another health problem. Scientists do not understand what causes essential tremor, but they do know that it can be passed on within families.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Essential tremor can start at any time in life, sometimes as early as childhood. More commonly, essential tremor becomes noticeable in the young adult or later years. The tremor tends to affect the hands and arms and can affect one side (left or right) more than the other.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     People who have essential tremor usually shake when they try to hold their arms outstretched and still. They also tend to shake when they are doing a goal-directed movement, such as writing, drinking from a glass of water or touching their nose with their finger. In fact, the shaking tends to get worse as the person is about to reach his or her goal.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Essential tremor sometimes affects the head, resulting in a repeated \"yes-yes\" nod or a repeated \"no-no\" headshake. Usually, people who have these symptoms also have shaking in the hands or a tremor in the voice, although the head can be affected on its own. Rarely, the legs and upper body are affected.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Essential tremor is frequently called a \"benign\" tremor because it does not usually affect your ability to perform daily tasks. However, it can be severe enough in some people that it causes a serious limitation in lifestyle.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     To determine what type of tremor you have and what might be causing it, your healthcare provider will need to ask you a list of detailed questions about your tremor. He or she will probably ask:",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Does your tremor happen when you are resting, when you stand still, when you hold your arms outstretched, or when you are moving?",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Are there activities or circumstances that make the tremor better or worse?",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Which body parts are affected? Are the left and right side are equally affected?",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       When did the tremor start? Did the start-time coincide with any other symptoms, starting new medications, or any injuries or illnesses?",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Does drinking alcohol affect the severity of your tremor? (Some types of tremor, particularly essential tremor, improve temporarily with alcohol)",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Your description of the tremor and your healthcare provider's observations of the tremor hold the most important clues about your condition. Your healthcare provider may recommend brain scans or blood tests to rule out certain problems, but there are no conventional lab tests that can diagnose Parkinson disease or essential tremor, the two most common causes of tremor.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     To diagnose these conditions, a healthcare provider must rely on old-fashioned medical sleuthing and skilled observation. That's why it's so important that you share as many details as possible, even if they seem unimportant to you.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     During the examination, your healthcare provider may ask you to stand and hold your arms outstretched, or ask you to do other things that might elicit or worsen the tremor. For instance, he or she may ask you to touch your nose with one finger, or to show a sample of your handwriting. Seeing how the tremor changes under these circumstances can help determine what the cause of your tremor might be.",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Lab tests",
"     </span>",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels or to check for copper or other metals in the blood",

"     If a tremor is caused by another medical problem, treating that problem (assuming it can be treated) sometimes helps alleviate the tremor, too. For example, people whose tremor is caused by excess thyroid hormone often stop shaking when their hormone levels are restored to normal.",

"    <p>",
"     Likewise, people whose tremor is caused by Parkinson disease sometimes improve when they begin treatment for the disease. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Gold compounds have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for over 50 years, although their usage has decreased substantially with the introduction of antirheumatic medications with better ease of use and side effect profiles. Gold has also been used to treat other disorders, including pemphigus, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis affecting peripheral joints, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Unfortunately, the benefit of gold treatment is limited by the high incidence of adverse effects. Most complications are minor, including local dermatitis, stomatitis, transient hematuria, and mild proteinuria [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34918/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. More serious reactions are rare and involve the hematopoietic system (eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, aplastic anemia), kidneys (nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency), and liver (cholestatic jaundice) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34918/abstract/2\">",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A growing number of reports of a variety of pulmonary manifestations complicating or associated with gold therapy have been published [",

"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The clinical characteristics of gold-induced pulmonary disease will be reviewed here. The use of gold in the treatment of rheumatic diseases and the side effects of gold on extrapulmonary organ systems are discussed separately. (See",

"     FORMS OF PULMONARY DISEASE",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Several forms of pulmonary disease occur among patients treated with gold, including chronic interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, and bronchiolitis obliterans [",

"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Chronic interstitial pneumonitis is the most common presentation of gold-induced lung disease and on histopathology is consistent with nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Advanced disease has features of fibrosis, such as traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34918/abstract/5\">",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Organizing pneumonia",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Gold salts have been a common cause of drug-induced organizing pneumonia, although gold salts are more likely to cause nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage than organizing pneumonia [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34918/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Bronchiolitis accompanies the predominant parenchymal alterations in a few cases. Some of these cases are recognized as gold-related bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia [",

"     \"Bronchiolitis in adults\"",
"    </a>",
"    .) However, all cases occurred in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, who are prone to develop pure bronchiolitis obliterans. Thus, it is difficult to know whether these cases resulted from gold-induced airway injury. Gold salts may act as a co-factor in the disease process, as in bronchiolitis obliterans associated with",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    All patients (with or without lung disease) treated with gold salts will have identifiable gold in their lungs. Immunofluorescence examination of lung tissue also reveals deposits of immunoglobulins. However, there is no relationship between gold concentrations in lung tissue and the occurrence of gold-induced pneumonitis [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This finding is similar to that observed with gold-induced injury in other tissues, since the presence of gold in hair, nail, and skin is also not helpful in predicting the presence or likelihood of toxicity. For example, gold levels are identical in skin lesions and in normal-appearing skin of patients with gold-induced dermatitis [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of gold-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) are incompletely understood. Pulmonary toxicity appears to result from alterations in the immune responses that are effective in controlling rheumatoid arthritis, but which exert a negative influence upon maintenance of other lung homeostatic mechanisms [",

These patterns can also be seen in patients with interstitial lung disease due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA-ILD). (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Colonic diverticular disease is common, and appears to be increasing in incidence [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34919/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The prevalence is age-dependent, increasing from less than 5 percent at age 40, to 30 percent by age 60, to 65 percent by age 85. Among all patients with diverticulosis, 70 percent remain asymptomatic, 15 to 25 percent develop diverticulitis, and 5 to 15 percent develop some form of diverticular bleeding (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76964 \" href=\"UTD.htm?14/57/15261\">",
"     algorithm 1",

"     \"Epidemiology and pathophysiology of colonic diverticular disease\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic review will focus on the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of symptomatic diverticular disease. The epidemiology and pathophysiology of diverticular disease, the treatment of diverticulitis, and diverticular bleeding are discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?35/63/36854?source=see_link\">",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The clinical manifestations of diverticulosis depend upon the presence or absence of complications. Uncomplicated diverticulosis is often an incidental finding (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52545 \" href=\"UTD.htm?36/50/37665\">",
"     picture 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). Some patients with diverticulosis complain of symptoms such as cramping, bloating, flatulence, and irregular defecation. However, it is unclear if these symptoms are attributable to the underlying diverticulosis or to coexistent irritable bowel syndrome. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?21/59/22455?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The major complications of diverticular disease are diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. Some authors have noted that complications are more likely in individuals who are obese, but the strength of this association is uncertain [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34919/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Diverticulitis",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Diverticulitis represents micro- or macroscopic perforation of a diverticulum (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68076 \" href=\"UTD.htm?29/35/30261\">",
"     picture 2",
"    </a>",
"    ). The primary process is thought to be erosion of the diverticular wall by increased intraluminal pressure or inspissated stool within a diverticulum; inflammation and focal necrosis ensue, resulting in perforation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A small perforation may be walled off by pericolic fat and mesentery. This may lead to a localized abscess or, if adjacent organs are involved, a fistula or obstruction. In comparison, poor containment results in free perforation and peritonitis.",
"   </p>",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Parents of infants and young children with recurrent wheezing often ask &ldquo;Does my child have asthma?&rdquo; This is a question that clinicians involved in patient care, and also those researching asthma, would like to be able to answer. Preschool wheezing, a symptom that can herald the subsequent development of childhood asthma, is a common problem worldwide [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, the condition improves and ultimately disappears by school years in many children. Proper identification of infants and young children at increased risk to develop persistent asthma may help predict long-term outcomes and improve prevention and treatment, but the ability to identify these children remains limited.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Several classifications of wheezing phenotypes and other tools have been developed in an effort to categorize children with recurrent wheezing and determine which will ultimately develop asthma. These wheezing phenotypes and predictive tools are reviewed in this topic. The definition and diagnosis of asthma in children; asthma risk factors, genetics, and natural history; bronchiolitis and virus-induced wheezing; and other causes of wheezing in children are discussed separately.

"     WHEEZING PHENOTYPES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Almost 50 percent of children are reported to have wheezing in the first year of life, although only 20 percent will experience continued wheezing symptoms in later childhood [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Wheezing phenotypes have been defined to identify the characteristics and risk factors associated with children that experience wheezing [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Some of these phenotypes describe children who continue to wheeze until later childhood, while others identify those who continue to wheeze through adolescence and adulthood. However, the relationship between risk factors and the subsequent development of asthma in later childhood and adult life is not clear.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Many of these early childhood wheezing phenotypes were determined retrospectively in longitudinal studies. However, it can be difficult to clinically distinguish among these phenotypes during the preschool years, because of the variation in expression of both symptoms and risk factors over time. In addition, the application of these phenotypes to diverse populations is not established and it is not clear which are the most effective therapies for a particular wheezing phenotype or whether early intervention can alter the course and outcome over time.",

"     Epidemiologic phenotypes",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Several epidemiologic phenotypes, based upon wheezing history, have been developed. There is some variability in age cutoffs differentiating among transient, persistent, and late-onset wheezing and inconsistencies in which risk factors are associated with each phenotype. There are also concerns about the prospective validity of these phenotypes.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In the Tucson Children&rsquo;s Respiratory Study (TCRS), four different wheezing phenotypes were identified among 1246 newborns followed for lower respiratory tract infections based upon the presence of wheezing symptoms during the first three years of life and again at age six years [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/2\">",

"   <p>",
"    Children in the persistent wheezing and late-onset wheezing groups are at increased risk for persistent asthma-like symptoms into adolescence and adulthood.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A report from the Italian Studies of Respiratory Disorders in Childhood and the Environment (SIDRIA) found a different frequency of the above phenotypes [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The classification was the same as the Tucson classification with the exception that the cutoff for distinguishing between transient early wheezing and persistent wheezing was two, not three, years of age. Of the 16,333 children aged six to seven years in this population-based cohort, 83 percent had never wheezed, 7 percent had transient early wheezing, 4 percent had persistent wheezing, and 6 percent had late-onset wheezing.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective longitudinal study of a population-based cohort in the United Kingdom, looked at maternal report of child wheezing between birth and six months and again between 30 and 42 months in 8594 children [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Early infant wheeze was defined as those who wheezed during the first six months, late-onset wheeze as those who wheezed between 30 to 42 months but not early infancy, and persistent wheeze as those who wheezed during both periods. A parental history of asthma (particularly maternal) and a personal history of atopic disease were predictive of wheezing in all three groups. Wheezing only during early infancy was associated with other factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy and the presence of older siblings, whereas persistent wheezing was associated with preterm delivery and lower socioeconomic status.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The wheezing phenotypes from the Avon study were further refined with continued longitudinal follow-up [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Data was collected at more time points and over shorter intervals than the Tucson study. Incorporation of objective measures (eg, lung function and allergen sensitization) and use of more sophisticated statistical methods led to the inclusion of two additional phenotypes to the Tucson classification (prolonged early wheeze and intermediate-onset wheeze):",

"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These categories share some similarities with both the epidemiologic and symptom-based phenotypes. It is not known whether these phenotypes are persistent over time. Factors examined in the cluster analysis included disease severity, wheezing triggers, family and personal history of atopy, inflammatory markers, and chest radiograph results. Most of the children had uncontrolled or partially controlled wheezing and were treated with inhaled glucocorticoids.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The three wheezing clusters identified were:",

"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Mild episodic viral wheeze (59.3 percent) &ndash; Most children in this group had mild disease, wheezing triggered by viral upper respiratory infections (URIs), and normal chest radiographs. Wheezing symptoms were controlled without the use of high dose inhaled glucocorticoids.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Nonatopic uncontrolled wheeze (28.5 percent) &ndash; Children in this group typically had moderate to severe disease with continued wheezing despite treatment with high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, abnormal chest radiographs, and parents with asthma. This cluster had the highest percentage of girls.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Atopic multiple-trigger wheeze (12.2 percent) &ndash; This group was characterized by multiple wheezing triggers (eg, URIs, exercise, cold air), higher percentage of boys, eczema, increased laboratory markers of atopy (eg, elevated total and specific IgE), and abnormal chest radiographs.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Epidemiologic phenotypes are limited by their retrospectively defined patterns of duration of wheeze. This led to the proposal of phenotypes based upon temporal patterns of wheeze that can be applied prospectively and may therefore be more useful when making treatment decisions.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The European Respiratory Society defined two symptom-based phenotypes [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/12\">",

"     <li>",
"      Multi-trigger wheeze &ndash; Wheezing both during discrete exacerbations and between episodes; triggers include viruses, allergens, exercise, and cigarette smoke",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Airway function, particularly conductive airways ventilation inhomogeneity, was lower in multiple trigger than episode wheeze, suggesting that these are functionally different phenotypes [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, in one study, over half of children classified into these two phenotypes based upon their wheezing history in the previous year switched to the other phenotype in the ensuing year [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34920/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, these phenotypes do not appear to be stable. The use of an unstable phenotypic classification may be challenging for clinicians, because it may lead to uncertainty and misunderstanding among the providers and parents of these children. Another limitation of this classification was that it was based primarily upon the clinical observations of its members rather than experimental evidence.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Genetic factors, perinatal exposures, and their interactions may contribute to the development of asthma. Other genetic, environmental, developmental, and host factors can alter the expression or persistence of the asthma phenotype over time. Some of these clinical indicators of risk are used in various predictive models to help the clinician identify those children who will continue wheezing into older childhood. Asthma risk factors are discussed in greater detail separately, but the key risk factors identified from the wheezing phenotypes studies are reviewed here. (See",

"      Wheezing phenotypes have been defined to identify the characteristics and risk factors associated with children that experience wheezing. These include several epidemiologic phenotypes that are based upon wheezing history and symptom-based phenotypes that are based upon temporal patterns. The most well-known of these phenotypes is the classification from the Tucson cohort, which divided young children with wheezing into the following groups: early, transient wheezers; persistent wheezers; and late-onset wheezers. The European Respiratory Society defined two symptom-based phenotypes: episodic (viral) wheeze and multi-trigger wheeze. (See",

"      Genetic, environmental, developmental, and host factors may contribute to the development of asthma and can alter the expression or persistence of the asthma phenotype over time. The major risk factors identified in various wheezing phenotype studies include the presence of atopy (in both the child and the parents), reduced lung function, and viral infections in infancy, particularly with rhinovirus.

"      Mast cells release a wide variety of mediators upon activation. These mediators can be divided into three overlapping categories: preformed mediators, newly-synthesized lipid mediators, and cytokines and chemokines. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H1\">",
"       'Introduction'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Preformed mediators are stored in secretory granules and released into the extracellular environment within seconds to minutes after mast cell activation. They are responsible for many of the acute signs and symptoms of mast cell-mediated allergic reactions. These mediators include histamine, neutral proteases,",
"      <a class=\"drug drug_general\" href=\"UTD.htm?39/34/40489?source=see_link\">",
"       heparin",
"      </a>",
"      proteoglycans, and some cytokines, such as TNF-&alpha;. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Preformed mediators'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Following activation, mast cells use membrane phospholipids to synthesize additional eicosanoid mediators: prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT), and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These mediators appear from 15 minutes to several hours after activation. Eicosanoids cause some of the symptoms of allergic reactions, and are also important in cell recruitment and antigen presentation. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Newly synthesized lipid mediators'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Mast cells produce multifunctional cytokines and chemokines that recruit and activate other cells to the inflammatory microenvironment. These include the Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, which are thought to be important in the perpetuation of the allergic response, and several chemokines that recruit neutrophils and activate fibroblasts. (See",

"     GENERAL ISSUES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In developed countries, advances in medical care have resulted in significant improvements in survival of premature infants, reaching a plateau in the late 1990s [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34922/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In particular, survival rates markedly improved for very low birth weight (VLBW) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants who are at the greatest risk for neurodevelopmental disability [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34922/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In the United States, data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network noted survival rates of 72 percent for infants with gestational ages 22 to 28 weeks who were born between 2003 and 2007 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/6/34922/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In addition, there has been a 21 percent rise in the overall proportion of preterm births since 1990 in the United States, which peaked in 2006 with 12.8 percent of all live births born at a gestational age (GA) &lt;37 weeks. (See",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The increase in premature births and the improved survival rate have outpaced any concomitant decrease in the rate of long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae. As a result, in the United States, survivors of premature birth account for approximately 45 percent of children with cerebral palsy, 35 percent of children with vision impairment, and 25 percent of children with cognitive or hearing impairment [",

"    Although infants of any GA may have a neurodevelopmental deficit, the rates of neurodevelopmental disabilities increase with decreasing birth weight and GA. This has been well studied in prevalence studies of cerebral palsy (CP), where it is well established that the risk of CP increases with decreasing gestation and is discussed in detail separately.
