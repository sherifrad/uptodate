"    The bcr-abl tyrosine kinase is a constituitively active kinase which functions by binding ATP and transferring phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on various substrates. This causes the excess proliferation of myeloid cells characteristic of CML. Imatinib (STI571,Gleevec) functions by blocking the binding of ATP to the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, inhibiting its activity. In the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, substrates required for bcr-abl function cannot be phosphorylated and subsequent cellular events are abrogated.",

"       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that accidental ingestion by children of over-the-counter (OTC) imidazoline derivative eye drops and nasal sprays may result in serious harm. The eye drops and nasal sprays involved in cases of accidental ingestion contain the imidazoline derivatives tetrahydrozoline, oxymetazoline, or naphazoline. Serious adverse reactions (eg, coma, bradycardia, respiratory depression, sedation) requiring hospitalization were reported in children &le;5 years who had ingested even small amounts (eg, 1-2 mL). These products should be stored out of reach of children at all times; parents and caregivers should note that not all products are packaged in child-resistant packaging. If a child accidentally ingests these products, parents and caregivers should contact a poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 and seek emergency medical care immediately.",

"    <p>",
"     Lymphoma is a cancer of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes circulate in the body through a network referred to as the lymphatic system, which includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. The organs and vessels of the lymphatic system work together to produce and store cells that fight infection (",

"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common type of lymphoma. Although there are more than 50 types of NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type, making up about 30 percent of all lymphomas. In the United States, DLBCL affects about 7 out of 100,000 people each year.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     DLBCL is a fast-growing, aggressive form of NHL. DLBCL is fatal if left untreated, but with timely and appropriate treatment, approximately 60 percent of all patients can be cured. The following discussion will review the risk factors, classification, symptoms, treatment, and prognosis of this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",

"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Age, gender, and ethnicity affect a person's likelihood of developing DLBCL. Although DLBCL has been found in people of all age groups, it is found most commonly in people who are middle-aged or elderly. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 64 years. Men are slightly more likely to develop DLBCL than women. In the United States, white people are more likely to develop this type of lymphoma than are Asians or Blacks.",

"      WHAT IS DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The lymph organs include the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. These help to fight infection throughout the body. The organs of the lymphatic systems are connected by a network of lymphatic and blood vessels, through which lymphatic fluid flows (",
"     <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64350 \" href=\"UTD.htm?23/55/24439\">",
"      figure 1",
"     </a>",
"     ). Lymphatic fluid contains white blood cells called lymphocytes.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     There are two primary types of lymphocytes: B-cells and T-cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of B lymphocytes. Almost all lymphocytes begin growing in the bone marrow or lymph nodes. T-cells leave the bone marrow before they are completely matured, and finish maturing in the thymus gland. B-cells instead continue to develop and mature in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. In DLBCL, the abnormal B-cell lymphocytes are larger than normal, and they have stopped responding to signals that usually limit the growth and reproduction of cells. This specific subtype of lymphoma is called diffuse large B-cell because the malignant large B-cells grow within a lymph node in random locations throughout the lymph node (diffusely) without a specific pattern or architecture.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     DLBCL can either develop as a transformation from a less aggressive form of lymphoma or as a first occurrence of lymphoma (called de novo).",

"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA SYMPTOMS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The first sign of DLBCL is often a quickly growing, non-painful mass that is typically an enlarged lymph node in the neck, groin, or abdomen. Patients may also experience fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats, or other symptoms.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H5\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Extranodal disease",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In about 40 percent of cases, the cancer does not begin in the lymph nodes, but instead develops elsewhere. This is called extranodal disease. The most common site of extranodal involvement is the stomach or gastrointestinal tract, but the disease can arise in virtually any normal organ.",

"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H6\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Advanced versus localized disease",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Most patients (about 60 percent) are not diagnosed with DLBCL until the disease is advanced (stage III or IV). In the remaining 40 percent of patients, the disease is confined to one side of the diaphragm (above or below the diaphragm). This is called localized disease.",

"      DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSIS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The diagnosis of DLBCL is confirmed by removing part or all of an enlarged lymph node with a biopsy. This procedure may be performed with local anesthesia if the involved tissue is relatively close to the skin's surface. If the node is deeper, general anesthesia is required. The cells from the tissue are then examined in detail using a microscope and other techniques.",

"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     When a stage is assigned, it also includes a letter, A or B, to denote whether fever, weight loss, or night sweats are present. \"A\" means these symptoms are not present; \"B\" means they are. For example, a person with stage 1B disease has evidence of cancer in one lymph node region and has \"B\" symptoms (fever, weight loss, or night sweats). (See",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Chemotherapy drugs work by interfering with the ability of rapidly growing cells (like cancer cells) to divide or reproduce themselves. Because most of an adult's normal cells are not actively growing, they are less affected by chemotherapy, with the exception of bone marrow (where the blood cells are produced), the hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.",

"    <p>",
"     Immunotherapy uses antibodies that target a specific group of cells (usually cancer cells). Rituximab is an antibody that targets B lymphocytes.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The most common chemotherapy regimen for advanced DLBCL is called R-CHOP. R-CHOP includes rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. The first four drugs are given into a vein (IV) over the course of one day, while prednisone is taken by mouth for five days. In the United States, this regimen is generally given every three weeks for 6 to 8 cycles.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     A cycle of chemotherapy refers to the time it takes to give the treatment and then allow the body to recover from the effects. Thus, eight cycles of treatment would last 24 weeks (approximately five months). During this time, patients are closely monitored for signs of drug toxicity and side effects.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD, MIM #248600) also known as branched-chain ketoaciduria, is a disorder affecting the aliphatic or branched chain amino acids. It is caused by a deficiency of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD), the second enzyme of the metabolic pathway of the three branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. It is characterized by psychomotor retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor of the urine.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Maple syrup urine disease will be reviewed here. A general discussion of amino acid disorders is presented separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/26/27047?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Inborn errors of metabolism: Classification\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     EPIDEMIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;MSUD occurs in approximately 1 in 86,800 to 185,000 live births [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/1-3\">",
"     1-3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. It occurs more frequently in inbred populations, such as the Mennonites in Pennsylvania, where the incidence may be as high as 1 in 200 births [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATHOPHYSIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The branched-chain amino acids are important precursors to compounds needed for gluconeogenesis, energy production, and synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. End-products of their metabolic pathways are acetyl-CoA, acetoacetate, and succinyl-CoA.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In the first metabolic step, leucine, isoleucine, and valine are converted into their respective alpha-ketoacids by cytosolic or mitochondrial aminotransferases. Rare cases of branched-chain aminotransferase deficiency have been reported.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    MSUD is caused by decreased activity of BCKD, the second enzyme in the degradation pathway. This enzyme complex catalyzes decarboxylation of the alpha-ketoacids of leucine, isoleucine, and valine to their respective branched-chain acyl-CoAs.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     BCKD complex",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The BCKD complex is situated on the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of three catalytic components (E1, E2, and E3) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The E1 component catalyzes decarboxylation of the three alpha-ketoacids and is mediated by thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). E1 is comprised of two distinct subunits, E1-alpha and E1-beta, that form an alpha-2-beta-2 heterotetramer. A lipoic acid moiety in the E2 or acyltransferase component helps transfer the branched-chain acyl group from E1 to CoA. The E3 or dehydrogenase component is a flavoprotein. It resets the lipoyl moiety to the active oxidized form. This component is also associated with the alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes, pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The BCKD complex also is associated with two regulatory enzymes, BCKDC phosphatase and BCKDC kinase. These control the activity of the BCKD complex by reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Decreased activity of BCKD results in elevation of plasma concentrations of the branched-chain amino acids and corresponding keto acids. A metabolite of isoleucine causes the urine to smell like maple syrup. The neurotoxicity of MSUD is caused primarily by the accumulation of leucine in the plasma and organs, known as leucinosis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/4,6\">",
"     4,6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. High leucine concentrations appear to impair regulation of cell volume. This results in decreased serum sodium concentration and increased intracellular water, leading to cerebral edema. Another mechanism of neurotoxicity may be increased production of glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) caused by the rapid transport of leucine across the blood-brain barrier [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     GENETICS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The genes encoding BCKD complex components E1-alpha, E1-beta, E2, and E3 have been mapped to human chromosomes 19q13.1-q13.2, 6p22-p21, 1p31, and 7q31-q32, respectively, and have been sequenced [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/7-10\">",
"     7-10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Mutations in these genes are responsible for MSUD. Mutations in the regulatory enzymes have not been reported.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CLINICAL FEATURES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There are five distinct phenotypes of MSUD: classic, intermittent, intermediate, thiamine-responsive, and E3-deficient [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In most cases, these do not correlate with specific mutations. However, they can be distinguished based upon age of onset, severity of clinical symptoms, and response to thiamine treatment.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Classic MSUD typically presents in newborns. The intermediate, intermittent, and thiamine-responsive forms may present at any time during infancy or childhood, mostly during episodes of stress. Intermediate MSUD presents rarely in adults [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Classic MSUD",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Classic MSUD is the most common form of the disorder. Cases have been associated with mutations in the genes for E1-alpha, E1-beta, and E2. Newborns typically develop ketonuria within 48 hours of birth and present with irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and dystonia [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. By four days of age, neurologic abnormalities include alternating lethargy and irritability, dystonia, apnea, seizures, and signs of cerebral edema. In some cases, initial symptoms may not develop until the infant is four to seven days of age, depending upon the feeding regimen. Breastfeeding may delay onset of symptoms to the second week.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Episodes of metabolic intoxication may occur in affected older infants or children who usually are controlled by nutritional management [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These episodes often are caused by increased catabolism of endogenous protein that may be induced by intercurrent illness, or by exercise, injury, surgery, or fasting. Clinical manifestations include epigastric pain, vomiting, anorexia, and muscle fatigue. Pancreatitis is an occasional finding. Neurologic signs may include hyperactivity, sleep disturbance, stupor, decreased cognitive function, dystonia, and ataxia. A clinical picture similar to Wernicke encephalopathy has been reported in cases of acute decompensation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Death may occur from cerebral edema and herniation. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?9/62/10217?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Intermediate MSUD",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Intermediate MSUD is a rare disorder that has been associated with mutations in the E1-alpha component of BCKD [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Residual BCKD activity typically is 3 to 30 percent of normal. Patients may become symptomatic at any age. Presentation is later in those with greater enzyme activity [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/9,12\">",
"     9,12",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The clinical signs are characterized by neurologic impairment and developmental delay of variable extent. Seizures may occur in some patients. Episodes of acute metabolic decompensation are rare.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Intermittent MSUD",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Intermittent MSUD is the second most common type of MSUD. Affected patients have normal growth and development. They typically present with ketoacidosis during episodes of catabolic stress, including intercurrent illnesses, such as otitis media. Signs of neurotoxicity develop, including ataxia, lethargy, seizures, and coma. Death may occur without appropriate recognition and treatment.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Thiamine-responsive MSUD",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thiamine-responsive MSUD is a rare phenotype that has been associated with mutations in the E2 component of BCKD [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/10,13\">",
"     10,13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Clinical presentation is similar to the intermediate form. In general, affected patients do not respond to thiamine supplementation alone, and dietary restriction of branched-chain amino acids is needed to achieve metabolic control. In fact, only one reported case has shown true thiamine-responsiveness [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     E3-deficient MSUD",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mutations in the gene encoding the E3 component of BCKD result in a very rare form of MSUD, with few reported patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Affected patients have combined deficiencies of BCKD and the pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. Clinical features are similar to intermediate MSUD. However, E3-deficient patients typically present in the newborn period and also have lactic acidosis.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DIAGNOSIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The most important diagnostic test for MSUD is the measurement of plasma amino acid concentrations. Affected patients have elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). Urine organic acid measurement will detect elevated levels of branched-chain ketoacids, lactate, and pyruvate.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Detection using high-pressure liquid chromatography of alloisoleucine, a metabolite of leucine, and 2-oxo-3-methylvaleric acid, is diagnostic for MSUD. However, alloisoleucine may not appear until six days of age, even when leucine levels are elevated.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Detection of alloisoleucine is also helpful to differentiate MSUD from ketotic hypoglycemia. Branched chain amino acid concentrations may be transiently elevated in ketotic hypoglycemia or in the post-absorptive state, but alloisoleucine will not be present. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?8/0/8201?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Classic MSUD in newborn infants is readily detected only by screening using tandem mass spectrometry. Recall rates may be reduced by use of a second-tier method to analyze alloisoleucine in dry blood spots [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, affected newborns may be symptomatic before the results are available. Newborn screening may not detect milder or variant forms of the disorder [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27590/abstract/16,17\">",
"     16,17",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    BCKD enzyme activity can be measured in lymphocytes or cultured fibroblasts. However, this test is not necessary for diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed by measuring enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or choriovillus cells. Mutation analysis should be performed in all patients with MSUD, especially when prenatal diagnosis is anticipated for future pregnancies.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MANAGEMENT",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Management of MSUD has two components: dietary therapy to promote normal growth and development and prompt treatment of episodes of acute metabolic decompensation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Dietary therapy",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The goal of dietary therapy is to achieve normal plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids, especially leucine. This is accomplished by restricting intake of branched-chain amino acids using commercially available formulas and medical food.

"     <li>",
"      Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD, MIM #248600) also known as branched-chain ketoaciduria, is caused by a deficiency of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKD). (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Pathophysiology'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      MSUD has autosomal recessive inheritance. The genes encoding the four components of BCKD complex have been mapped to human chromosomes 19q13.1-q13.2, 6p22-p21, 1p31, and 7q31-q32. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Genetics'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Patients with classic MSUD typically develop ketonuria, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and dystonia within 48 hours of birth. However, depending upon the feeding regimen, the onset of symptoms may be delayed to the second week of life. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H7\">",
"       'Classic MSUD'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Patients with intermediate MSUD have residual BCKD activity that ranges from 3 to 30 percent of normal and may become symptomatic at any age. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H8\">",
"       'Intermediate MSUD'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Patients with intermittent MSUD typically present with ketoacidosis during episodes of catabolic stress; death may occur without appropriate recognition and treatment. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"       'Intermittent MSUD'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      When plasma amino acids concentrations are measured, patients with MSUD have elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). When urine organic acids are measured, patients with MSUD have elevated levels of branched-chain ketoacids, lactate, and pyruvate. Detection of alloisoleucine (a metabolite of leucine) and 2-oxo-3-methylvaleric acid with high pressure liquid chromatography is diagnostic for MSUD. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H12\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry readily detects classic MSUD; however affected newborns may develop symptoms before the results are available. Newborn screening may not detect milder forms of the disorder. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H12\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Prenatal diagnosis can be performed in an experienced laboratory by measuring enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or choriovillus cells. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H12\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Mutation analysis should be performed in all patients with MSUD, especially when prenatal diagnosis is anticipated for future pregnancies. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H12\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Management of MSUD has two components: dietary therapy to promote normal growth and development and prompt treatment of episodes of acute metabolic decompensation. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H13\">",
"       'Management'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The goal of dietary therapy is to achieve normal plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Dietary restriction is maintained throughout life. (See",

"       'Dietary therapy'",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Water and electrolyte homeostasis in newborn infants is influenced by physiologic adaptations following birth and developmental effects on the distribution of total body water and water loss. Fluid and electrolyte therapy must account for these factors in determining maintenance requirements and correction of any abnormalities.",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DISTRIBUTION OF BODY WATER",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Total body water is composed of extracellular fluid (ECF), which includes intravascular and interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. The distribution between these compartments changes with increasing gestational age [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Compared to an infant born at 27 weeks, a newborn term infant has a total body water that comprises a smaller fraction of body weight (75 versus 80 percent) and an ECF volume that is a smaller fraction of total body water (45 versus 70 percent) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Infants normally lose weight during the first week after birth. This weight loss is greater in preterm than term infants (approximately 10 to 15 versus 5 percent) and is associated with a diuresis. The postnatal diuresis is approximately 1 to 3",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/kg",
"    </span>",
"    per hour in term infants and is greater in preterm infants. Physiologic weight loss results primarily from an isotonic reduction in extracellular water, although the mechanism for this process is uncertain [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/1\">",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     SOURCES OF WATER LOSS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Water loss can occur through the kidneys, skin, and lungs. The absolute and relative amounts of water loss through these routes change with development. Excessive loss of other fluids, such as stool, gastric drainage, or thoracostomy output, can lead to water and electrolyte disturbances.",

"    per hour, allows excretion of a normal solute load, typically in a dilute urine. Changes in urinary water and electrolytes occur with changes in blood flow and maturation of renal function. The proportion of cardiac output directed to the kidneys increases during gestation and after birth. This proportion is 2 percent during the first week after birth at term, 8.8 percent at five weeks of age, and 9.6 percent at one year [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",

"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The Na-H exchanger and Na-glucose cotransporter on the luminal membrane, which permit filtered sodium and glucose to be reabsorbed and hydrogen to be secreted (resulting in bicarbonate reabsorption) [",

"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The reduced levels of these proteins limit the ability of immature infants to vary sodium excretion and to retain water. Depending upon intake, the impairment in sodium handling can lead to hyponatremia, hypernatremia, or volume depletion or expansion, whereas the impairment in water reabsorption increases the risk of excessive water loss and hypernatremia.",

"     Skin",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Evaporation through the skin can result in large insensible water losses in newborns. These may be excessive in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants with very thin skin. As the skin matures with increasing gestational and postnatal age, evaporative loss is reduced, becoming less significant after 28 weeks gestation and one week after birth. As an example, insensible water loss in an infant born at 24 weeks gestation may be approximately 200",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/kg",
"    </span>",
"    per day compared to 20",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/kg",

"    per day for a term infant. Water loss also may be excessive in conditions in which skin integrity is compromised (eg, epidermolysis bullosa, abdominal wall defect).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Radiant warmers increase evaporative water loss by approximately 50 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Use of humidification and plastic wrap may minimize this loss [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Heat-emitting phototherapy devices also increase transepidermal water loss [",

"     11,12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, devices using the high-intensity gallium nitride light-emitting diode phototherapy system have no effect on transepidermal water loss [",

"     Respiratory",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;With the typical ambient humidity in the nursery, approximately one-half of insensible losses in term infants is caused by water loss through the respiratory system [",

"     14,15",
"    </a>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, in preterm infants, skin water loss is greater than respiratory loss. Respiratory loss also increases with increasing respiratory rate.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Effect of antenatal glucocorticoids",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Antenatal administration of glucocorticoids to promote lung maturation in preterm infants also results in maturation of the skin and kidneys. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?30/55/31610?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery\"",
"    </a>",
"    .) In one report, water and sodium homeostasis during the first week after birth were compared in ELBW infants exposed and not exposed to antenatal glucocorticoids [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/16\">",
"     16",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Exposed infants had lower insensible water loss, less hypernatremia, and an earlier diuresis and natriuresis than unexposed infants. These changes were thought to result from enhanced epithelial cell maturation that improved the barrier function of the skin. In experimental studies, glucocorticoid exposure resulted in maturation of ion channels in the proximal renal tubular epithelium [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/17,18\">",
"     17,18",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In another report, exposure to antenatal glucocorticoids prevented the nonoliguric hyperkalemia that frequently occurs in ELBW infants [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/19\">",
"     19",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The mechanism is uncertain but may be related to enhanced stabilization of cell membranes and upregulation of Na-K-ATPase activity, leading to a decrease in the movement of potassium from intracellular to extracellular compartments.",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MONITORING",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Careful monitoring is essential to maintaining the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes in newborns. It consists of performing serial physical examinations, measuring body weight, monitoring intake and output, and performing laboratory studies.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Physical examination",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Physical examination should include signs of cardiovascular stability (heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill), state of hydration (skin turgor, mucus membrane status, fullness of the anterior fontanelle), and the presence or absence of edema. Body weight should be measured at least daily.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Volume overload is suggested by excessive weight gain, edema, and increased blood pressure. Inadequate fluid administration may be accompanied by weight loss, tachycardia, poor capillary refill, and, in severe cases, hypotension. Volume deficits can occur when third spacing takes place, such as with sepsis or ileus. In this case, body weight may be increased rather than decreased.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Intake and output",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;For the first few days after birth, fluid intake and output of urine and stool should be followed closely, especially in preterm infants or those with acute illness. Urine specific gravity may also be a helpful indicator of fluid status.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    On the average, approximately 50 percent of administered fluid is excreted as urine and the remainder is lost through the skin and respiratory tract. With increased fluid administration, the urine becomes more dilute and accounts for the excretion of more than one-half of water intake [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/20\">",
"     20",

"     Serum electrolyte concentrations",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;For most newborns receiving parenteral fluids, serum electrolyte concentrations should be measured daily or every other day. The specific monitoring schedule depends upon gestational and postnatal age, as well as the infant's clinical condition. Because the newborn ELBW infant has very high insensible water losses, serum sodium concentration may need to be measured more frequently during the first few days to avoid inadequate or excessive administration of free water [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27591/abstract/21\">",
"     21",

"     Effect of pH on potassium",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Potassium is primarily an intracellular cation. The distribution of potassium between intracellular and extracellular compartments depends in part upon the pH of each compartment.

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Excessive loss of other fluids, such as ileostomy or gastric drainage, thoracostomy output, polyuria caused by osmotic diuresis, or repeated removal of cerebrospinal fluid must also be measured and replaced.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The term \"ultrasound\" refers to sound waves of a frequency greater than that which the human ear can appreciate, namely frequencies greater than 20,000 cycles per second. For diagnostic ultrasound imaging in obstetrics and gynecology, frequencies of 2 to 12 million cycles per second are used. Ultrasound imaging has been used for medical purposes for several decades and is safe when properly performed [",

This information is also vital for maintaining the safety of this technology for the woman and, during obstetrical examinations, her fetus.",

"     SOUND WAVES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Sound waves are a type of mechanical vibration. They are described in terms of their frequency, which is the number of repetitions (ie, cycles) per second. The unit for measuring frequency is the Hertz (Hz). Other characteristics of sound waves are wavelength, the distance between excitations; the amplitude of excitation, measured in decibels (dB); and the period, the time it takes for one cycle to occur, measured in seconds.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The speed with which an acoustic wave moves through a medium is dependent upon the density and resistance of the medium. Media that are dense will transmit a mechanical wave with greater speed than those that are less dense. As an example, the acoustic speed of a mechanical wave through air is 331",

"    Frequency and wavelength are mathematically related to the velocity of the ultrasound beam within the tissue as indicated by the following equation:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Velocity = Wavelength (mm) &nbsp;x &nbsp;frequency (Hz)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Ultrasound is an ideal means for imaging soft tissues and fluid collections typically evaluated by obstetrician-gynecologists. Given the known speed of sound in water and soft tissue, measuring the transit time between initiation of the mechanical pulse and its return can be used to determine the depth, size, and characteristics of the anatomic structure under study.",

"     INTERACTION OF ULTRASOUND WAVES WITH TISSUES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;When an ultrasonic wave travels through a homogeneous medium, its path is a straight line. However, when the medium is not homogeneous or when the wave travels through a medium with two or more interfaces, its path is altered. The relationship between ultrasound waves and tissues can be described in terms of reflection, scattering, refraction, and attenuation. The last three factors all act to decrease the magnitude of the ultrasound wave.",

"     Reflection",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;When an ultrasound beam \"hits\" a tissue",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     boundary/interface,",
"    </span>",
"    a certain amount of the ultrasound is reflected back to the transducer. The magnitude of the reflected wave is dependent on the acoustic impedance of the tissue:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Acoustic impedance = tissue density &nbsp;x &nbsp;propagation velocity",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Tissues with increased density reflect a greater proportion of the ultrasound beam. The most intense reflection occurs when air is encountered. Air has an impedance dramatically lower than any other tissue in the body and diagnostic ultrasound imaging is unable to penetrate air-containing structures such as bowel. In contrast, the ultrasound beam is virtually completely transmitted through fluid and few or no echoes are produced.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The magnitude of the reflected beam received by the transducer is also dependent upon the angle between the ultrasound beam and tissue interface. Since the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, the \"optimal\" return of the reflected ultrasound occurs at a 90&ordm; (perpendicular) orientation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Scattering",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Small structures, eg, less than 1 wavelength in lateral dimension, result in scattering of the ultrasound signal. Unlike a reflected beam, scattering results in the ultrasound beam being radiated in all directions, with minimal signal returning to the transducer.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Echoes returning to the transducer are \"back-scattered\" echoes because they are dependent upon reflection and scattering. The degree of strength of the returning echoes is translated into varying shades of brightness, which is the basis for B-mode display of ultrasound data. Gray-scale imaging is vitally dependent upon the relative intensity of these \"back-scattered\" echoes.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Refraction",
"    </span>",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Attenuation",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;During transmission, ultrasound signal strength is progressively reduced due to absorption of the ultrasound energy by conversion to heat, a process called attenuation. Attenuation is frequency and wavelength dependent. The depth of penetration is limited to approximately 200 wavelengths, corresponding to a depth of 30 cm for a 1 MHz transducer, 12 cm for 2.5 MHz transducer, and 6 cm for a 5 MHz transducer.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Attenuation is also dependent upon acoustic impedance and any mismatch in impedance between adjacent structures. Any tissue with high impedance, such as bone, will lead to increased attenuation of the ultrasound beam. Those tissues with low impedance, such as water, will allow the ultrasound beam to continue to be transmitted, and will result in less attenuation. An easy rule of thumb is that bone absorbs approximately 10 times that of soft tissues, and soft tissues absorb approximately 10 times more than fluids [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Given the rules of physics, as noted above, and heterogeneity of human tissue, ultrasound interrogation results in many possible variations in the displayed image. Some of these displayed images will vary based on well-recognized artifacts of ultrasound imaging. Intimate knowledge of how ultrasound interacts with tissue and the artifacts that can occur is fundamental to properly assess ultrasound-generated images. A complete list of artifacts is beyond the scope of this topic, but some of the most important artifacts encountered in obstetrical and gynecologic imaging are briefly described below:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Shadowing occurs when there is a particularly strong reflector or attenuator leading to a diminished ultrasound beam with the resultant loss of imaging data distal to the reflector or attenuator. This is commonly seen in the third trimester fetus with progressive mineralization of the fetal bones.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Increased through transmission occurs when there is less attenuation than surrounding tissues, typically due to a fluid-filled structure such as a cyst. Understanding through transmission is essential for differentiating solid versus cystic ovarian masses.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Reverberation artifacts occur when two or more intensely reflective interfaces cause the ultrasound beam to echo, potentially causing echoes to appear in cystic structures, simulating solid elements. Changing the path of the ultrasound beam may eliminate this artifact.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Refraction artifacts occur when non-linear bending of sound occurs due to a change in the tissue being insonated. This causes structures to incorrectly appear in the expected location given the scanning area. The result can be a duplication of the anatomic structure in question.",

"     TRANSDUCERS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ultrasound waves are generated from piezoelectric crystals, which consistently produce high frequency ultrasound waves when electrically stimulated. Applying an electrical potential to piezoelectric crystals causes the crystals to mechanically deform, and this deformation leads to formation of an acoustic wave. This is known as the piezoelectric effect. Natural crystals, especially quartz, were used for many years to generate ultrasound waves, but now synthetic crystals or ceramics are more commonly used. These crystals have a thickness of less than 1 mm.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Piezoelectric crystals are arranged in various ways at the core of the ultrasound transducer. Each transducer crystal functions as both a transmitter and receiver of mechanical energy. The transmitted mechanical pulse lasts approximately one microsecond, thus 1000 mechanical pulses can be sent in one second. The crystal then waits to receive the returning echoes, which it converts back into electrical energy. The strength of this signal is directly dependent on the amplitude of the returning wave. Display of these returning electrical signals (echoes) creates the images used in diagnostic sonography [",

"     2,3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Two methods of electronic excitation of the crystals are used. Multiplexing involves exciting a crystal or a small group of crystals, and awaiting the returning echoes prior to exciting the next group of crystals. These images are typically rectangular in configuration. With phased array excitation, the crystals are stimulated all at once as a unit with slight delay between each crystal. The image produced is that of a sector scan [",

The shape of the transducer also significantly alters the qualities of the image and affects visualization of various tissues. During an ultrasound examination, it may be necessary to use multiple transducers to evaluate different structures of interest [",

"     </li>",

"     RESOLUTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Resolution refers to the ability to distinguish between two closely related structures and varies directly with the frequency and inversely with the wavelength. Diagnostic ultrasound uses wavelengths of 0.1 to 1.5 mm. If two separate structures are closer than one wavelength apart, then they will not be identified as separate. Therefore, smaller wavelengths are associated with improved resolution [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27592/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. High frequency, short wavelength ultrasound can separate objects that are less than 1 mm apart.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Given the interrelationship of acoustic speed, wavelength, and frequency, smaller wavelengths with improved resolution are associated with higher frequencies. The downside of the better resolution achieved with higher frequencies is lack of penetration of the ultrasound beam. Therefore, the sonologist chooses the transducer with the highest frequency that has the penetration necessary to visualize a particular anatomic structure. Frequencies of ultrasound probes that are used in medicine range from 1 to 20 MHz, with those in obstetrics and gynecology typically in the 2 to 12 MHz range.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Resolution is described as axial or lateral:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Axial resolution is the ability to distinguish between two structures that are in the same direction as the acoustic wave. The axial resolution is equal to half of the spatial pulse length. Any adjacent structures that are closer than half of the spatial pulse length will not be able to be distinguished as separate structures. Axial resolution will be improved if the pulse frequency is increased, if there is a decrease in wavelength, or number of cycles in a single pulse.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Lateral resolution refers to distinguishing between two closely located adjacent structures that are perpendicular to the acoustic wave. Lateral resolution is equal to the diameter of the ultrasound beam. This distance can vary with the depth from the transducer. A structure that is smaller than the beam diameter may be detected, but its exact location within the ultrasound beam will not be able to be determined. A smaller beam diameter will improve lateral resolution. Increasing frequency can also improve lateral resolution [",

There are various methods for displaying these data, but ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology relies on the use of B-mode. The display can be static or in real-time. Static images show the distance from the transducer to various interfaces or tissues, the spatial locations of specific interfaces, and the physical or anatomic characteristics of the specific interfaces. Real-time imaging also provides temporal relations of these interfaces [",

The brightness of the amplitudes in B-mode is represented as pixels. Echoes with greater intensity are displayed with greater degrees of brightness. B-scans use B-mode data and display it in two dimensions, providing a static gray-scale ultrasound image.",

A single image or frame can be obtained with ease. Frame rates of at least 15 per second are generally considered a minimum for real-time imaging [",

This level of increase is not felt to be clinically significant. Similarly, diagnostic ultrasound used for medical imaging does not appear to cause cavitation at usual obstetrical acoustic output levels as long as the Mechanical Index (MI) is kept below 1.0 (see",

"    The ultrasound wave affects the tissue through which it travels by mechanical vibration and heating of this tissue. Mechanical vibration can result in cavitation or the formation of gas bubbles. This is an effect that typically occurs at the interface of tissues and gas. Because there is no gas within the uterus, this is not thought to be a significant factor in obstetrical sonography at the currently used levels of diagnostic sonography.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Thermal effects have the greatest potential for adversely affecting the fetus. Routine B mode, as is used for typical two-dimensional (2D) imaging, does not increase the temperature above the 1 to 1.5 degree Celsius range that is thought to be safe for fetuses, especially those early embryos at the time of embryogenesis. Spectral Doppler ultrasound, however, uses higher energy and focuses the acoustic energy that is created on a much smaller volume of tissue than typical 2D imaging does, and can result in changes in tissue temperature, especially at bone-tissue interfaces. For this reason, Doppler ultrasound should be used with great care, especially early in pregnancy [",

Antiretroviral therapy was associated with early survival, and survival at one year improved from 40 percent in 1992 through 1993 to 63 percent in 1996 through 1998. It is highly likely that survival is now considerably better than this estimate, as this study was conducted both before and shortly after the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy.",

"     TIMING OF ART",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The appropriate time to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with PCP who are not already on such therapy is not clear, but data supporting earlier therapy are accumulating. Potential risks of ART in this setting include drug-drug interactions, overlapping toxicities, increased pill burden, and the potential for eliciting an immune reconstitution illness [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27593/abstract/48,49\">",
"     48,49",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, patients with PCP are generally severely immunosuppressed with marked CD4 cell count depletion, and hence starting ART offers potential clinical benefits that counter these concerns. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/35/23098?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\"",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    ACTG 5164 was a randomized trial in 282 participants (63 percent of whom had PCP) designed to determine the optimal timing of ART relative to the treatment of an OI [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27593/abstract/50\">",
"     50",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Compared with \"deferred ART\" (ie, initiation after completion of OI therapy), \"early ART\" (ie, initiation within two weeks of OI therapy) reduced the risk of AIDS progression and deaths by almost half. Early initiation of ART was not associated with a worsening rate of HIV RNA suppression or an increase in adverse events; in addition, IRIS occurred with equal frequency in both treatment arms.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A retrospective analysis of 278 patients admitted to intensive care units in Brazil found that starting ART while in the ICU was associated with a 50 percent reduction in mortality [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/60/27593/abstract/51\">",
"     51",
"    </a>",
"    ]. While confounding cannot be excluded given the study design, these data support the clinical benefit of early ART initiation with acute OIs.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Due to these findings, in the treatment-naive patient we recommend initiation of ART within two weeks of PCP treatment. In the patient already on ART, continuation of antiretroviral medications is advised.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    If suspected IRIS occurs after initiating ART, clinicians should have a low threshold for starting or resuming corticosteroids; some also might consider resuming anti-PCP therapy. In general, ART should be continued.",

"      In developed countries, the rate of multiple births is increased because of the use of fertility treatments and older maternal age. In the United State, twins and triplets naturally occur in approximately 1 in 80 and 1 in 8000 pregnancies. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Incidence'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Multiple births can be dizygotic (resulting from the fertilization of two separate ova), or monozygotic (resulting from a single fertilized egg that subsequently divides into two separate individuals). Monozygotic multiple births have an increased perinatal rate due to cord entanglement and twin-twin transfusion. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Zygosity'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The most serious risk of multiple gestations is spontaneous preterm delivery. The risk of prematurity increases as the fetal number increases. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H12\">",
"       'Preterm birth'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Other adverse effects of multiple births include intrauterine growth restriction resulting in small for gestational age infants, discordant growth (which is associated with an increased risk of fetal death, and neonatal mortality and morbidity), and twin-twin transfusion. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H13\">",
"       'Fetal growth'",

"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H24\">",
"       'Twin-twin transfusion syndrome'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Mortality rates of infants are higher in multiple than singleton pregnancies due to increased rates of prematurity, growth abnormalities, obstetric complications, and congenital anomalies (eg, conjoined twins). (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H19\">",
"       'Mortality'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",

"      The risk of cerebral palsy is increased among infants of multiple births compared with those from singleton births. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H20\">",
"       'Neurodevelopmental outcome'",
"      </a>",

"      Multiple births have a significant financial and psychosocial impact on families. (See",

"      Neonatal management includes being aware of the issues that occur more commonly at the birth of multiple infants. (See",

"      Breastfeeding is challenging for mothers of multiple infants. Mothers can and do produce enough milk for twins and triplets. Mothers who wish to breastfeed should be supported and additional guidance should be given to optimize the feeding of her newborn infants. (See",

"    This figure illustrates the problem of attempting to control pain via the use of around-the-clock dosing alone (solid black line). Note that, in order to completely control all of the episodes of breakthrough pain (pain level peaks, shaded blue), around-the-clock medication would have to be raised nearly to overmedication levels (dotted line). The solution to this problem is to have the option to deliver small additional doses of opioids during the breakthrough pain events. The alternative strategy of increasing the baseline dose of medication to treat breakthrough pain may result in over-sedation.",
