"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     External otitis is a condition that occurs when the ear canal becomes irritated. The ear canal is the part of the ear that leads from the outer ear to the ear drum (",
"     <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \" href=\"UTD.htm?29/61/30677\">",
"      figure 1",
"     </a>",
"     ). External otitis can develop as a result of an infection, allergy, or skin problem. \"Swimmer's ear\" is the name for external otitis that occurs in a person who swims frequently.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     External otitis is different from otitis media (middle ear infections). When a person says that they have an ear infection, they usually mean that they have otitis media. (See",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Cleaning the ear canal removes ear wax. Ear wax serves to protect the ears from water, bacteria, and injury. Excessive cleaning or scratching can injure the skin, potentially leading to infection.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Swimming on a regular basis removes some of the ear wax, allowing water to soften the skin. Bacteria, which normally live in the ear canal, can then enter the skin more easily.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Wearing devices that block the ear canals, such as hearing aids, headphones, or ear plugs, can increase the risk of external otitis (if worn frequently) by injuring the skin.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Treatment of external otitis aims to reduce pain and eliminate the infection. Most people with external otitis can be treated at home. If your infection is severe or your eardrum is ruptured, you will be referred to an ear-nose-and throat specialist (an otolaryngologist) for an examination and treatment.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     In some cases, your healthcare provider will flush out your ear with water and hydrogen peroxide before you begin treatment; this speeds healing by removing dead skin cells and excess ear wax.",

"      Ear drops",

"       Lie on your side for 20 minutes or place a cotton ball in the ear canal for 20 minutes.",
"      </li>",

"      </li>",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;During treatment, you should avoid getting the inside of your ears wet. While showering, you can place a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly in the ear. However, you should not swim for 7 to 10 days after starting treatment. Avoid wearing hearing aids and in-ear headphones until pain improves.",

"     Blood is essential for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and other substances to tissues throughout the body. Donated blood can be lifesaving for individuals who have lost blood because of accidents or surgery, as well as for people who have become severely anemic or have dangerously low platelet counts because of certain medical conditions",

"     For people who are considering donating blood, a local blood bank can describe the criteria for being a blood donor. The websites at the end of this topic also include information about eligibility criteria (see",

"      Medical history interview",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;All blood donors are asked questions about their medical history to help determine whether they can safely donate blood without experiencing any negative health effects [",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Heart and lung disease &mdash; Potential donors are asked if they have ever had heart, lung, or blood diseases. In general, people with heart disease, heart valve conditions, irregular heartbeat, disease of the blood vessels in the brain, heart failure, and certain lung conditions are not allowed to donate blood unless this has been cleared with their healthcare provider.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Other medical conditions &mdash; Potential donors are asked if they feel healthy and well on the day of donation.",

"      <li>",
"       Seizures &mdash; People with a history of seizures can donate blood, provided they have had no seizures within a certain period of time (usually one to six months).",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Recent surgery &mdash; People who have undergone recent surgery are permitted to donate blood when healing is complete and they have resumed full activity. However, if a transfusion was given at the time of surgery, donation is not allowed for one year.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Pregnancy &mdash; Women who are pregnant are not permitted to donate blood during pregnancy and for six weeks after the pregnancy ends.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Age requirement &mdash; The minimum age for blood donation is 16 or 17 years, depending upon the state. When allowed, 16-year-olds must bring a signed permission form from a parent. In most cases, there is no upper age limit for donation, although approval from the donor's physician is required in some cases.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Weight requirement &mdash; Individuals weighing less than 50 kg (110 pounds) are not permitted to donate blood. The less a donor weighs, the greater the likelihood of having a reaction, such as dizziness and fainting following donation. Although reactions to blood donation are rare, individuals weighing between 50 and 54 kg (110 and 119 pounds) are most likely to experience reactions. Most blood centers perform an additional evaluation of donors aged 16 to 18 who are just over the weight limit, which takes into account the donor&rsquo;s estimated blood volume, calculated from the donor&rsquo;s height and weight.",

"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Vital signs &mdash; The pulse, blood pressure, and temperature of a donor are checked before donation.

"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Blood test &mdash; A small blood sample is taken from a fingerstick and tested to check for the number of red cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. This is done to ensure that the donor is not anemic or likely to become anemic or iron deficient after they donate. Individuals with hemoglobin levels that are too low are temporarily not permitted to donate blood. (See",

"      Time interval until next donation",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Donors are eligible to donate no sooner than 56 days after their previous donation. However, this minimum interval can vary, depending upon how rapidly the person's body is able to replenish their red blood cells. Some donors, especially women who have heavy menstrual periods, will not be able to donate every 56 days because their iron stores are not sufficient to replenish the lost red blood cells.",

"      APHERESIS DONATION",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     A technology called apheresis has made it possible to collect specific components of blood during the donation procedure. Apheresis is used to selectively collect red blood cells, platelets (blood components that play an important role in clotting), plasma, and granulocytes (a type of infection-fighting white blood cell).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Red blood cells &mdash; Donors can give red blood cells by apheresis once every 16 weeks. This is less frequent than whole blood donation because a greater amount of red blood cells are collected during the apheresis procedure.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Platelets &mdash; Donors can give platelets up to 24 times per year. Approximately 1 percent of people have a mild reaction to one of the substances (citrate) that is mixed with the blood during platelet donation; the reaction can include feelings of numbness and tingling, muscle cramping, and nausea. The reaction can be treated or prevented by taking a calcium supplement before or during the donation.",
"      </li>",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Although a complete discussion of the abnormalities in mineral metabolism that occur &nbsp;in patients with chronic renal failure is beyond the scope of this chapter, it is useful to review briefly how the homeostatic mechanisms governing calcium and phosphate balance can be impaired in this setting due to alterations in phosphate excretion and in PTH and calcitriol release [",

"     PHOSPHATE BALANCE AND SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Renal failure is characterized by a decrease in the functioning renal mass and, therefore, in the total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). With the initial fall in GFR, there is a reduction in the filtered phosphate load and consequently in phosphate excretion. If intake remains constant, the net effect will be phosphate retention and a small increase in the plasma phosphate concentration. This mild phosphate retention is intimately related to the common development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. As illustrated in Figure 1 (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68602 \" href=\"UTD.htm?28/43/29373\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ), progressive renal failure is associated with a marked increase in circulating PTH levels that correlates roughly with the degree of decline in GFR. If, however, phosphate retention is prevented by restricting phosphate intake, secondary hyperparathyroidism does not occur [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/4,5\">",
"     4,5",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is incompletely understood. It was initially thought that excess phosphate will drive the following reaction to the right [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/6\">",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The ensuing reduction in the plasma Ca2+ concentration can then stimulate the secretion of PTH which, by increasing Ca2+ release from bone and phosphate excretion in the urine, will return both the plasma Ca2+ and phosphate concentrations to normal (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56732 \" href=\"UTD.htm?24/46/25325\">",
"     figure 2",
"    </a>",
"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    However, several observations are not compatible with this hypothesis. First, the initial minor degree of hyperphosphatemia may not be sufficient to cause a large enough reduction in the plasma Ca2+ concentration to enhance PTH release [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Second, maintenance of normocalcemia by the administration of Ca2+ does not prevent the development of hyperparathyroidism [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    An alternate and not mutually exclusive theory is that phosphate retention acts by diminishing the renal production of calcitriol&nbsp;[",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/1,9\">",
"     1,9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This will then lead to hyperparathyroidism both by lowering the plasma Ca2+ concentration and by removing the inhibitory effect of calcitriol on PTH secretion [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/9,10\">",
"     9,10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The following observations are compatible with this hypothesis:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Plasma calcitriol levels are often reduced in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, not elevated as would be expected from the presence of hyperparathyroidism [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/11,12\">",
"       11,12",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Even the finding of normal or near normal calcitriol levels does not necessarily preclude a role for initial calcitriol deficiency, since the secondary hyperparathyroidism will increase calcitriol synthesis.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The institution of dietary phosphate restriction is able to reverse many of the abnormalities in mineral metabolism: the plasma level of calcitriol is increased, while that of PTH is diminished [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/13,14\">",
"       13,14",

"       13",
"      </a>",
"      ]. In advanced renal failure, the decline in PTH secretion can occur without change in the plasma levels of calcitriol (presumably due to the marked reduction in functioning renal mass) or of Ca2+. This observation suggests that hyperphosphatemia itself may contribute to the hyperparathyroidism, a theory that has been confirmed in both experimental and humans studies [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/15-17\">",

"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Partial resistance to the action of calcitriol also may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperparathyroidism. In particular, normal concentrations of calcitriol may be unable to suppress PTH secretion, perhaps due to a decreased number of calcitriol receptors in the parathyroid gland [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/19\">",
"     19",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This change can be demonstrated relatively early (when the plasma creatinine concentration has only doubled) in experimental animals; at a later stage, retained uremic toxins may contribute by decreasing both receptor synthesis and hormone-receptor function [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/20,21\">",
"     20,21",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This defect may also explain why supraphysiologic levels of calcitriol (via intravenous or intraperitoneal administration) can markedly diminish PTH release in patients on maintenance dialysis, while physiologic oral doses are relatively ineffective [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/10,22,23\">",
"     10,22,23",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Regardless of the exact mechanism, the hypersecretion of PTH is initially appropriate, since it tends to normalize both the plasma Ca2+ and phosphate concentrations. This effect is not complete as some patients may have a mild elevation in the plasma phosphate concentration of less than 1",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mg/dL;",
"    </span>",
"    this minor degree of hyperphosphatemia may be sufficient to cause the persistent impairment in calcitriol release and therefore the continued drive to PTH secretion [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26822/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, each succeeding decrement in GFR will enhance the tendency toward phosphate retention, thereby requiring a further rise in PTH release (",

"     1-3",

"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/min.",
"    </span>",
"    Because of the inhibitory effect of PTH on proximal phosphate reabsorption, the fraction of the filtered phosphate that is reabsorbed can fall from the normal value of 80 to 95 percent to as low as 15 percent in severe renal failure [",

"     24",

"    ]. At this point, PTH is unable to further increase phosphate excretion but continues to promote phosphate release from bone, resulting in persistent hyperphosphatemia if intake is not diminished. This may lead to the development of a vicious cycle since, as noted above, hyperphosphatemia in advanced renal failure can directly stimulate further PTH release [",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Typical blood pressure measurements include a systolic and diastolic value, which represent the extremes of pressure fluctuation within the circulation during the cardiac cycle. There has been much debate about which increased value alone, either systolic or diastolic hypertension, is more predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in various patient populations. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?42/4/43080?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults\"",

"     \"Hypertension: Who should be treated?\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Mean arterial pressure measurements, which provide another indication of overall circulatory pressure load, have also been proposed as predictive for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This is either determined directly by catheterization or can be estimated by formulas (such as diastolic blood pressure +",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     1/3",
"    </span>",
"    x [systolic pressure &ndash; diastolic pressure]). However, the mean arterial pressure provides less discriminatory power as patients age. The diastolic pressure peaks at and subsequently declines after age 55 years, while the systolic pressure rises relentlessly with each decade of life [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26823/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, depending upon the respective changes in systolic and diastolic pressures with older age, the mean blood pressure may actually tend to change less as individuals age.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Since the diastolic pressure in a population rises until the sixth decade and then subsequently declines with increasing age, an elevation in the diastolic pressure alone is less useful as an outcome predictor in older patients. Increasing emphasis has therefore been placed upon systolic pressure alone as the most useful predictor of cardiovascular disease in these individuals. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?24/27/25018?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Treatment of hypertension in the elderly patient, particularly isolated systolic hypertension\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Several guidelines have supported the use of systolic blood pressure (such as JNC-7) and strongly encourage the use of systolic blood pressure goals in antihypertensive treatment [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26823/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There is also an enhanced risk for cardiovascular events associated with increases in pulse pressure (defined below). This topic review will discuss the factors that determine pulse pressure and will present some of the evidence for and against the suggestion that there is an independent link between an increased pulse pressure and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.",

"     CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The pulse pressure is",
"    <strong>",
"     defined",
"    </strong>",
"    as the systolic minus the diastolic pressure. This value appears, at least in some epidemiologic studies, to be superior in predictive value to the systolic or diastolic values alone (see",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"     'Increased pulse pressure and adverse outcomes'",
"    </a>",
"    below).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    However, given the predictive information from the systolic and diastolic pressures, it is unclear, at first glance, that the pulse pressure provides additional independent information. Among patients with a diastolic pressure of 95 mmHg, for example, a higher pulse pressure simply means that there is a higher systolic pressure which itself is a risk factor for worse outcomes. The pulse pressure also must be considered in the context of the absolute values of systolic and diastolic pressures (eg, a blood pressure of",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     120/80",
"    </span>",
"    mmHg is not equivalent in risk to",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     160/120",
"    </span>",
"    mmHg) [",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Pulse pressure and age",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;To better understand the purported associations among pulse pressure, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, risk of cardiovascular disease, and increasing age, it is worthwhile to review age-related changes in blood pressure measurements and the risk for cardiovascular disease as individuals age.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In patients less than 55 years of age, the diastolic and systolic blood pressures are both predictive of adverse events from cardiovascular disease. However, because the diastolic blood pressure declines on average after the age of 55, its predictive value is diminished in older patients.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    By comparison, the systolic pressure continues to rise with every decade of life, resulting in the maintenance of its predictive value for cardiovascular disease. Thus, in older patients, the association between an increased systolic pressure alone and cardiovascular disease becomes much stronger than that observed with the diastolic blood pressure alone.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    With increasing age, the pulse pressure correlates more closely with the systolic pressure than with the diastolic pressure, and is therefore also a good predictor of cardiovascular disease among the elderly. An additional benefit of the pulse pressure is that it incorporates both the systolic pressure increase and the diastolic decrease that is observed with age. In some cases, this measurement has superior predictive power to that observed with the systolic pressure alone. (See",

"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Increases in systolic pressure",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Elevations in systolic pressure, particularly among the elderly, are usually the result of stiffness in the large arteries as well as an early pulse wave reflection [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26823/abstract/4,5\">",
"     4,5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Although increases in peripheral vascular resistance appear to be a relatively more important component of hypertension in younger patients (30 to 49 years old), the role of peripheral vascular resistance in hypertension diminishes progressively with age [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26823/abstract/1,6\">",
"     1,6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Given the known effects of aging on vessel stiffness, increases in pulse pressure in older patients (eg, &gt;55 years of age) result from aortic stiffening, while increases in younger patients (ie, &lt;45 years of age) are more likely to result from increases in stroke volume. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?24/27/25018?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H2#H2\">",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Decreases in diastolic pressure",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Since stiffening of the aorta with age reduces the elastic reservoir capacity, more blood runs off from each stroke volume during systole, resulting in a reduced blood volume within the aorta at the onset of diastole. This factor, when combined with diminished elastic recoil and an increased pressure decay rate, causes a fall in the diastolic pressure with age [",

"    In general, women are shorter than men but tend to have faster heart rates. As a result, differences in pulse pressure with gender are generally lacking since the effect of height on pulse pressure may be counter-balanced by the effect of heart rate.",

"    Although it is generally thought that the aorta increases in size with age, some studies suggest that increases in pulse pressure are associated with reductions, not increases, in aortic diameter [",

However, pulse pressure was independently associated with risk, particularly among older men (aged 45 to 57 years). Among men younger than 45 years, pulse pressure was associated with mortality only in those with hypertension; among older men, pulse pressure was associated with an increased risk of death at any level of blood pressure.

"     CONCLUSIONS",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The literature appears to be divided on the prognostic values of the four measures of blood pressure: systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures. This arises in part because they are, basically, related to one another as they are all measures of the response in the circulation to each heartbeat. The value of one measure over another is strongly age dependent, and is also related to how variables are entered into statistical models that help predict cardiovascular outcomes.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The best use of pulse pressure at this time appears to be in providing help in revising the risk estimate of the systolic pressure in older individuals. Since systolic pressure predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in older patients, clinicians are encouraged to revise upward the estimate of cardiovascular risk in older patients when the pulse pressure is increased [",

"    ]. A reasonable summation of our knowledge is that diastolic blood pressure is the best predictor of cardiovascular disease risk in the young (&lt;50 years), all three blood pressure components are equally predictive at ages 50 to 59 years, and pulse pressure is the best predictor from age 60 years and beyond.",
"   </p>",

"      Pulse pressure is",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Increased pulse pressure may be due to either or both an increase in systolic or a decrease in diastolic blood pressures. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Factors resulting in increased pulse pressure'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Among older patients, increased systolic pressure results from increased stiffness in the aorta and other large arteries; among younger patients, increased stroke volume plays a more important role. (See",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Decreased diastolic pressure results from a reduction in aortic blood volume at the onset of diastole. This is related to the age-related decrease in elasticity of the aorta which causes more blood to run off during systole. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"       'Decreases in diastolic pressure'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The pulse pressure is a good predictor of cardiovascular events among elderly patients and in some cases has superior predictive capability to that provided by systolic pressure alone. The best use of pulse pressure is in revising upward the risk estimate provided by the systolic pressure in older individuals. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Acquired deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), also called acquired angioedema (AAE), is a rare syndrome of recurrent episodes of angioedema, without urticaria, which is associated with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders in some patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26824/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Angioedema typically affects the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The swelling is self-limited, although laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation. Clinically, this disorder is very similar to hereditary angioedema (HAE), although AAE most commonly develops in patients over the age of 40 years, some of whom have associated lymphoproliferative disorders, whereas HAE usually presents in younger patients who are otherwise healthy.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. The management and prognosis of this disorder are reviewed separately. (See",

"      In the group of 776 patients referred to the author's specialty center in Milan for angioedema without urticaria between 1993 and 2003, only 14 had an acquired C1-INH deficiency [",

"       3",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Twenty-one additional patients were identified among referrals during the next six years (2004 to 2009). At one point in time, we estimated that we had diagnosed 46 patients with AAE and 545 patients with HAE, for a ratio of approximately 1 patient with AAE for every 12 with HAE.",

As in hereditary angioedema (HAE), swelling episodes in AAE can be characterized into three types: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or upper airway. The similarities and differences between AAE and HAE are summarized here. A more detailed discussion of each type of attack is found in the topic review of hereditary angioedema. (See",

"     17",

"   </p>",

"    Normally, C1-INH interacts with its target proteases and is cleaved in the process. The cleaved and inactive inhibitor irreversibly binds to the protease and renders it inactive.

However, this is not the case, as most patients with AAE demonstrate profound depletion of components of the classical complement pathway, as evidenced by low C1q (the measurable component of the C1 complex, C1q-r-s), which is not seen in patients with HAE. In addition, not all AAE patients with low C1q values have detectable anti-C1-INH antibodies [",

"      Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency (also called acquired angioedema or AAE) is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema, without urticaria or pruritus. Swelling most often involves the subcutaneous tissues of the face and the submucosa of the upper airway and small bowel. AAE presents in the fourth decade of life or later. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Epidemiology'",
"      </a>",
"      above and",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Clinical manifestations'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Approximately 70 percent of patients with AAE are found to have an associated disorder. In one-half of cases, the disorder is malignant (most often non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and the other half, the associated condition is benign (most often MGUS). (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Associated disorders'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Angioedema in AAE is bradykinin-mediated, but the precise pathogenesis is undefined. Most patients have autoantibodies against the C1 inhibitor protein. These autoantibodies may impede the normal functioning of C1 inhibitor and cause a functional deficiency. Alternatively, the antibodies, or perhaps neoplastic tissue in some cases, may cause activation of the classical complement pathway, leading to depletion of normally functioning C1 inhibitor. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Pathogenesis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency (acquired angioedema, AAE) should be considered in a patient who presents with isolated angioedema (without urticaria) in the fourth decade of life or later, and has no family history of angioedema. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3419754\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Initial testing should consist of levels of C4, C1q, and C1 inhibitor (antigenic level). If C4 and C1q are low and C1 inhibitor antigenic level is low or normal, then C1 inhibitor function should be obtained. Low C1 inhibitor function confirms the diagnosis (",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      All patients with acquired C1 inhibitor disorders should be evaluated for an underlying B cell lymphoproliferative disorder at the time of diagnosis. If no disorder is found, we recommend repeating an evaluation annually. (See",

"     DEFINITION",

"   <p>",
"    Various definitions for refractory pemphigus have been utilized in the medical literature. In 2008, a panel of experts proposed standardized definitions for the assessment of therapeutic responses in pemphigus for use in clinical studies, including definitions of treatment failure from certain therapies [",

"     OVERVIEW",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pemphigus is a chronic disorder that usually requires treatment for a period of years. A retrospective study of 40 patients with pemphigus vulgaris who were seen in an academic medical center between 1983 and 1993 and followed for an average of 7.7 years found that long-lasting complete remission (ie, complete clinical remission off systemic therapy for at least six months) was achieved in 25 percent after two years, 50 percent after five years, and 75 percent after 10 years [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?26/12/26825/abstract/5\">",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although the majority of patients with pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceus (around 60 to 80 percent) can achieve at least initial improvement with first-line therapies [",

"     6-8",
"    </a>",
"    ], other patients fail to respond or experience frequent relapses while on these therapies. Our first steps for patients who fail initial therapy are to optimize the dose of the systemic glucocorticoid (up to a maximum of an equivalent of 1.5 to 2",

"     mg/kg",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (SS) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by diminished lacrimal and salivary gland function. This results in the &ldquo;sicca complex,&rdquo; a combination of dry eyes (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia). A variety of other disease manifestations may also be present, including systemic signs and extraglandular features. The ocular condition of aqueous tear deficiency is termed &ldquo;keratoconjunctivitis sicca&rdquo; (a literal Latin translation of dry inflammation of cornea) but is also called keratitis sicca, xerophthalmia, or dry eye syndrome.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other diseases and in a secondary form associated with other autoimmune rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The treatment of dry eyes in patients with SS will be reviewed here. Other issues in SS are discussed separately, including the clinical manifestations; the diagnosis; the treatment of dry mouth and other non-ocular sicca symptoms; and the treatment of extraglandular manifestations. (See",

"      Systemic antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The approach to management of patients with sicca symptoms is generally the same for primary or secondary SS and depends upon the severity of symptoms and upon the responsiveness to therapy. Patients with mild SS may only require general preventive and topical treatment for sicca symptoms, in addition to monitoring of their condition and usual medical and dental preventive care.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Most patients will benefit from multidisciplinary care. Treatment should be coordinated by a single clinician, usually a rheumatologist, in collaboration with the primary care physician and other clinicians. It is important that patients also be seen by an ophthalmologist with an interest in keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). The dentist is also a critical member of the team that cares for these patients. The participation of other specialists may be required, depending upon the patient&rsquo;s particular clinical manifestations. (See",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Comprehensive patient education should be provided regarding SS and its management, including use of available materials from professional societies and patient support groups. This is important because of the multisystem nature of the illness and because of the degree of self-care that is required. There should be particular attention to self-management strategies for tear conservation and for effective use of",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The aims of therapy for dry eyes are twofold: to provide relief of symptoms, including dryness, burning, and a sandy-gritty ocular irritation that gets worse as the day goes on, as well as itching, pain, ocular fatigue, diminished visual acuity, and pressure behind the eye; and to prevent injury of the eye, such as keratitis, erosions, neovascularization and ulceration of the cornea, and scarring of the ocular surface. Some experts prefer the use of the term &ldquo;dysfunctional tear syndrome&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;dry eye&rdquo; to reflect the inclusion of patients who have abnormalities in tear film composition but no reduction in tear volume.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There are few large, well-designed, randomized trials that have evaluated the ability of most specific measures to prevent the complications of dry eyes in patients with SS. Our general approach is based upon the available trial data, upon small studies in patients with dry eyes both with and without SS, and upon our clinical experience. Treatment choices should be based upon the severity of disease and the response to therapy [",

Particular attention to ocular exposure and care should be given to patients undergoing surgical procedures. (See",

"    This schema is applicable only to symptomatic patients who may be having an acute attack. Levels of ALA and porphobilinogen may be less increased in HCP and VP and decrease more quickly with recovery than in AIP; urine porphyrins may remain increased, but are subject to nonspecific increases. Mutation detection provides confirmation and greatly facilitates detection of relatives with latent porphyria.",
