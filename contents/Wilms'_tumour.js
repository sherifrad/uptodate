"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May also have failure to thrive, skin metastasis, exophthalmos, or periorbital ecchymoses. [115]  [34]  [116]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine catecholamines are elevated. [115]FBC showing anaemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia may suggest bone marrow infiltration in advanced stage IV neuroblastoma. [117]Cytogenetics shows MYCN gene amplification. [118]Neuroblastoma is heterogeneous in appearance on abdominal ultrasound and typically shows calcifications. Rarely shows tumour extension into the lumen of the renal vein and inferior vena cava. [115]Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy usually shows MIBG accumulation. [119]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> More common in males. [120]Does not present as bilateral disease.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Doppler ultrasound of abdomen followed by CT or MRI, usually reveals unicentric renal mass originating from renal medulla and involving the entire kidney.Histology is diagnostic: mucopolysaccharide matrix which gives the classic 'clear' appearance, fibrovascular septa, and small cord cells. [121]Bone scan and bilateral bone marrow biopsies may show bone metastases. [121]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients are usually older at presentation. [122]More common in males. [122]Higher incidence of metastasis at diagnosis (50%).May be associated with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. [123]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Histologically, tumour cells form papillae, tubules, or nests. Tumour cells may appear 'clear' due to accumulation of lipids and glycogen. Surrounding parenchyma may form a pseudocapsule due to compression.</p>",

[124]  Metastatic disease may cause bone pain and headaches.Neurological deficits secondary to metastatic disease (10% to 15% of RTK patients develop CNS lesions). [10]  [124]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Cytogenetics shows identification of hSNF5/INI1 gene mutation in tumour tissue. [125]MRI of brain identifies brain metastasis. [103]</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Autosomal-recessive form can present with renal failure in early infancy. [126]Autosomal-dominant form usually presents in adulthood and may present with anuria or renal failure. [126]Hypertension is more common.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Kidneys are generally enlarged and demonstrate multiple irregular cysts on ultrasound.Extrarenal cysts (e.g., liver, pancreas, and spleen) help to confirm diagnosis. [126]</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine and serum catecholamines are elevated. [127]Ultrasonography detects larger tumours easily. To better define the location and extent, a contrast CT or MRI should be obtained.Accumulate MIBG avidly; therefore, MIBG scintigraphy is used for tumour surveillance, and to identify extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas.

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> CT scan usually reveals a lobulated heterogenous mass with areas of necrosis. Tumour may involve adjacent bowel and mesentery. [128]</p>",
