"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Secretin infusion test is positive in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) (gastrin increase &gt;96.2 picomols/L [200 picograms/mL] above basal) but negative in antral G cell hyperfunction.This condition is differentiated from ZES. The presence of a gastrin-releasing tumour in ZES would give results of serum gastrin elevated to 96.2 picomols/L (200 picograms/mL) within 15 minutes of secretin infusion and fasting serum gastrin &gt;481 picomols/L (&gt;1000 picograms/mL). Both of these results would not be seen in hyperfunction and hyperplasia.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> PPI use can cause an appropriate fasting hypergastrinaemia. To diagnose ZES in patients on PPI therapy, a fasting serum gastrin level can be repeated 1 week following discontinuation of PPI. Alternatively, basal acid output (BAO) measured on PPI therapy should be low (&lt;10 mEq/hour) whereas BAO measured in patients with ZES must be high to make the diagnosis.</p>",
