"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions in urticarial vasculitis are typically painful, last longer than 24 hours, and often leave residual markings upon their resolution. These characteristics are all unusual in urticaria.",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Lesions are typically small macules or slightly raised papules, as opposed to the large wheals seen with simple urticaria.Can be associated with Darier's sign, which is characterised by urticaria and erythema upon rubbing, scratching or stroking affected skin.",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with systemic mastocytosis often have skin findings consistent with urticaria pigmentosa.Symptoms often include profound fatigue, and can other manifestations depend on the organ symptoms affected. Gastrointestinal complaints are most common.",
