"       What problems can women have when they breastfeed?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Women can have different problems when they breastfeed. Sometimes, women choose to stop breastfeeding when they have these problems. But most problems can be treated so that women can keep breastfeeding.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Some common breastfeeding problems and their treatments are listed below. Women can do many of the treatments on their own. Some women also find it helpful to work with a breastfeeding expert, called a &ldquo;lactation consultant,&rdquo; when they have problems.",

"       Engorgement",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Engorgement is the term doctors use for when the breasts are too full of milk. When the breasts are engorged, a baby can have trouble with &ldquo;latch-on.&rdquo; Latch-on is another word for when a baby makes a tight seal with his or her mouth around the nipple and the dark skin around the nipple (areola) (",
"      <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69241 \" href=\"UTD.htm?40/62/41967\">",
"       figure 1",

"      ). Breasts that are engorged can be swollen, hard, warm, and painful.",

"         figure 2",
"        </a>",
"        ). But don&rsquo;t let too much milk out or pump for more than 2 to 5 minutes. Pumping for too long or releasing too much milk can make engorgement worse.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Use an ice pack or take a pain-relieving medicine to reduce the pain.",
"       </li>",

"       </li>",
"       <li>",

"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Some nipple soreness is normal during the first minute of each breastfeeding session. Nipple pain that lasts the whole breastfeeding session is usually not normal. It can be caused by nipple cracks, blisters, or bruises. Nipple pain can happen for different reasons, such as when a baby does not have a good latch-on. It can also happen if a baby has a condition called &ldquo;tongue-tie.&rdquo;",

"       What is ductal carcinoma in situ?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ductal carcinoma in situ, often called &ldquo;DCIS,&rdquo; is an early form of breast cancer. It forms inside the ducts that carry milk to the nipple when a woman is breastfeeding (",
"      <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53453 \" href=\"UTD.htm?23/5/23640\">",
"       figure 1",
"      </a>",
"      ).",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      When a cancer is &ldquo;in situ,&rdquo; it means it has not spread beyond the place where it first formed. In the case of DCIS, it means the cancer is only in the duct and has not spread into the tissues around it. DCIS is curable in most cases.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23374513\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What are the symptoms of DCIS?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;DCIS does not usually cause symptoms, but in some cases, women feel a lump in their breast, or have blood coming from the nipple.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23374528\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Is there a test for DCIS?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yes. Most cases of DCIS are found during a mammogram, a special kind of x-ray used to find breast cancers. DCIS usually shows up on a mammogram as tiny spots, which doctors call &ldquo;calcifications,&rdquo; or as a shadow, which doctors call a &ldquo;density.&rdquo; If a woman has a mammogram showing an area that looks suspicious, she will usually have more detailed mammograms called &ldquo;magnification views.&rdquo; These give the doctor a close up view of the suspicious area and the rest of the breast tissue.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      If your mammogram shows a suspicious area, you will need a &ldquo;biopsy.&rdquo; That means that a doctor will take samples of breast tissue and send them to the lab to be checked for cancer. This is usually done using a needle, but some women must have a type of biopsy that involves surgery. Surgical biopsy, also called &ldquo;excisional biopsy,&rdquo; is done if the needle biopsy can&rsquo;t be done safely or accurately.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      To do a needle biopsy, the doctor will use x-rays to find the exact spot on the breast that looks suspicious. Then, he or she will insert a needle to take samples. Next, he or she will put a tiny metal clip into that spot. That way, a surgeon can easily find the same spot later.",
"     </p>",

"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       How is DCIS treated?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The treatment for DCIS depends on the characteristics of the cancer. Treatment options will be different depending on:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        The size and location of the tumor",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Whether the tumor is &ldquo;hormone sensitive,&rdquo; meaning that it has receptors for the female hormones estrogen or progesterone",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Treatment of DCIS starts with surgery to remove the cancer. Then, most women will have radiation treatment. Women with hormone sensitive cancers will also have a treatment called &ldquo;hormone therapy,&rdquo; which is described below. DCIS is not treated with chemotherapy.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",

"        <strong>",
"         Surgery to remove the cancer",
"        </strong>",
"        &ndash; If the DCIS is contained within a small area of the breast, the surgeon can usually save the breast using &ldquo;breast conserving surgery.&rdquo; If the DCIS is taking up a large area, the surgeon will probably have to remove the whole breast with a &ldquo;mastectomy&rdquo; (",
"        <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73172 \" href=\"UTD.htm?9/12/9412\">",

"        <strong>",
"         Breast conserving surgery",
"        </strong>",
"        , also called &ldquo;lumpectomy,&rdquo; is surgery to remove the cancer and a section of healthy tissue around it. Women who have this option keep their breast. But they usually also need radiation therapy after surgery to help keep the cancer from coming back. Women who have breast conserving surgery and radiation live just as long as those who have mastectomy. Still, women who have breast conserving surgery have a slightly higher chance than those who have mastectomy of having their cancer come back in the breast.",

"        <strong>",
"        </strong>",
"        the whole breast. Women who have this option can also have surgery to reconstruct the breast. If a mastectomy is done for DCIS, radiation is not needed.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Hormone therapy",
"        </strong>",
"        &nbsp;&ndash; Some forms of breast cancer grow in response to hormones. Women whose DCIS is &ldquo;hormone sensitive&rdquo; usually take hormone therapy after finishing surgery and radiation. Hormone therapy comes in the form of pills that block hormones in the body or keep the body from making them. This helps keep the cancer from coming back.",

"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23374558\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What happens after treatment?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;After treatment, you will need to be checked on a regular basis to see if the cancer comes back. You will have mammograms once a year and breast exams at least twice a year. If you are taking hormone therapy, you will need special lab tests to follow up on how the medicine is working. You should also watch for symptoms that could mean the cancer has come back, such as a new breast lump or pain. If you start having any new symptom, tell your doctor.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23374573\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What happens if cancer comes back?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;When DCIS comes back, it will be the same DCIS half the time and more serious invasive cancer half the time. Either way, if your cancer comes back, you will need more surgery. If you previously had breast conserving surgery and radiation, you will need a mastectomy, because you can&rsquo;t get radiation more than once in the same area of the body. If the cancer comes back as an invasive cancer, you will need more intensive treatment.",

"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23374588\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What will my life be like?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Most women with DCIS do very well after treatment. If you are on hormone therapy, it is very important to take your hormone medicines as directed. Talk to your doctor if you have any side effects from the medicines. It&rsquo;s also important to follow all your doctors&rsquo; instructions about follow up exams and tests.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ticks transmit a number of infections to humans and other animals. However, the toxins of various ticks can also cause a disease known as tick paralysis, which can be confused with both infectious and noninfectious conditions.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Tick paralysis was first described by explorers in the Australian outback in 1824 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Eighty-eight years later, the disease was recognized to occur in western Canada [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Tick paralysis has subsequently been found to affect humans and domestic and wild animals worldwide, although most cases occur in Australia and North America. Although it is a rare disease in humans, tick paralysis is important to recognize because it can be fatal or nearly fatal [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, if diagnosed promptly, this illness can be cured with the combination of tick removal and supportive care.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     EPIDEMIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There is no national surveillance system for tick paralysis and reliable information on incidence does not exist. However, the disease appears to be uncommon based upon available literature and clinical experience. As an example, only 33 cases were reported in Washington State in the 50 years between 1946 and 1996, even though tick paralysis was a reportable disease in this state until 1998 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Most cases in North America occur in the western regions of the United States and Canada, but the illness has also been seen in the eastern, southeastern, and south central United States. In addition, cases have been reported in urban areas in travelers returning from endemic areas [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/5,6\">",
"     5,6",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Four cases of tick paralysis were reported in patients from north central Colorado in 2006 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The clustering of these cases was unusual because in previous years, on average, only one case per year was reported from Colorado. Another unusual characteristic of this cluster was the age distribution of cases: only one of four cases occurred in a child. Previous case reports noted that tick paralysis was more likely to occur in children under the age of 10 years because tick toxins are more likely to cause symptoms in individuals with a smaller body mass.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Females are affected more often than males, possibly because ticks are more likely to remain undetected following attachment to individuals with long hair. As with other tick-borne diseases, most cases occur in the spring and early summer months [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/8\">",
"     8",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Tick vectors",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There are more than 800 known species of argasid (soft-shelled) and ixodid (hard-shelled) ticks, and over 40 individual tick species are capable of producing salivary toxins that can cause paralysis in humans and animals [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The tick species that cause most cases of human tick paralysis in the United States and Canada are Dermacentor andersonii (the Rocky Mountain wood tick), and D. variabilis (the American dog tick). Other ticks such as Amblyomma americanum (the Lone Star tick) (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71086 \" href=\"UTD.htm?23/1/23582\">",
"     picture 1",

"     picture 2",
"    </a>",
"    ), and I. pacificus (the western black-legged tick) (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60501 \" href=\"UTD.htm?26/25/27038\">",
"     picture 3",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The primary cause of tick paralysis in Australia is the scrub tick, I. holocyclus.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Studies using a hamster model of tick paralysis suggest that the ability of saliva from some strains of D. andersoni ticks to cause paralysis is a heritable trait [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This may explain why tick paralysis is uncommon in some regions (such as Alberta, Canada) despite a high prevalence of tick vectors [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/11\">",
"     11",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATHOGENESIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The onset of symptoms of tick paralysis occurs only after a female tick has attached and begun feeding. Symptoms do not typically develop until the tick has fed for four to seven days. The biological effect of tick salivary toxins is, in part, specific to the species of tick. Neurotoxins produced by Dermacentor ticks have a number of pathologic effects including [",

"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The precise mechanism for the development of the symptoms of tick paralysis is not fully understood. However, the toxin produced by Dermacentor ticks may interrupt sodium flux across axonal membranes in selected locations such as the nodes of Ranvier and nerve terminals [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This in turn may result in weakness through impairment of neural transmission to motor nerve terminals [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Neurotoxins produced by I. holocyclus act on presynaptic motor nerve terminals and inhibit the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition can result in total blockade of transmission at myoneural junctions and is temperature-dependent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Low-amplitude compound muscle action potentials can be demonstrated in neurophysiologic testing; motor conduction velocities, sensory studies, and repetitive stimulation are normal [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. While the toxin of I. holocyclus has not been completely characterized, it bears similarities to botulinum toxin. (See",

"     Symptoms and signs",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Tick paralysis caused by Dermacentor ticks usually begins with paresthesias and a sense of fatigue and weakness, although individual patients may sometimes appear irritable or restless and complain of muscular pain. Fever is characteristically absent, and there is no change in the sensorium or headache unless severe hypoxia or hypercarbia are present. Despite patients' reports of paresthesias, the sensory exam is typically normal. Most patients eventually develop an unsteady gait that progresses to an ascending complete paralysis. Deep tendon reflexes are characteristically absent. Respiratory paralysis and death can occur in severe cases.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In a review of 332 cases of tick paralysis published almost 60 years ago, the fatality rate was 12 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/16\">",
"     16",
"    </a>",
"    ]. By contrast, a more contemporary series of 33 cases reported a fatality rate of 6 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3494/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In most fatal cases, the diagnosis of tick paralysis was not considered antemortem.",

"      The toxins of various ticks can cause a disease known as tick paralysis, which can be confused with both infectious and noninfectious conditions. Tick paralysis affects humans and domestic and wild animals worldwide, although most cases occur in Australia and North America. Although it is a rare disease in humans, tick paralysis is important to recognize because it can be fatal or nearly fatal. However, if diagnosed promptly, this illness can be cured with the combination of tick removal and supportive care. (See",

"      The tick species that cause most cases of human tick paralysis in the United States and Canada are Dermacentor andersonii (the Rocky Mountain wood tick), and D. variabilis (the American dog tick). Other ticks such as Amblyomma americanum (the Lone Star tick) (",

"      ) have also been associated with human tick paralysis. The primary cause of tick paralysis in Australia is the scrub tick, I. holocyclus. (See",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The onset of symptoms of tick paralysis occurs only after a female tick has attached and begun feeding. Symptoms do not typically develop until the tick has fed for four to seven days. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Neurotoxins produced by Dermacentor ticks have a number of pathologic effects including slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity, lowering of the height of the nerve and muscle action potential, and impaired propagation of afferent nerve fiber signals. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Pathogenesis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",

"     <li>",
"      Neurotoxins produced by I. holocyclus act on presynaptic motor nerve terminals and inhibit the release of acetylcholine. (See",

"     <li>",
"      Tick paralysis caused by Dermacentor ticks usually begins with paresthesias and a sense of fatigue and weakness, although individual patients may sometimes appear irritable or restless and complain of muscular pain. Fever is characteristically absent, and there is no change in the sensorium or headache unless severe hypoxia or hypercarbia are present. Despite patients' reports of paresthesias, the sensory exam is typically normal. Most patients eventually develop an unsteady gait that progresses to an ascending complete paralysis. Deep tendon reflexes are characteristically absent. Respiratory paralysis and death can occur in severe cases. (See",

"     <li>",
"      Paralysis may be localized to one arm or leg, and isolated facial paralysis has occurred in patients who have ticks attached to their external ear canal. Patients with unilateral arm weakness have also been described, suggesting a brachial plexopathy associated with an engorged tick in the subclavian fossa.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Thoracic injury typically occurs as the result of forceful mechanisms that also cause serious associated injuries. Injuries that occur commonly as the result of thoracic trauma include pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, and rib fractures. These conditions are discussed separately. (See",

"     PULMONARY CONTUSION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pulmonary contusion is defined as pulmonary parenchymal damage with edema and hemorrhage, in the absence of an associated pulmonary laceration. It is more common than previously thought and may be associated with significant mechanisms of injury (such as motor vehicle collisions). Pulmonary contusion is discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/38/29285?source=see_link\">",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PULMONARY LACERATION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pulmonary lacerations occur rarely in children. In a large retrospective series describing thoracic injuries in children, 2 percent of the injuries were pulmonary lacerations, with a mortality rate of 55 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Pulmonary lacerations are caused by penetrating trauma, displaced rib fractures, deceleration forces, or sudden compression from a crush injury [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Tears in the parenchyma of the lung may cause bleeding, or less commonly, an air leak [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Patients typically present with hemoptysis, signs of respiratory distress, and hypotension (as the result of the associated hemopneumothorax).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Tube thoracostomy must be performed urgently to remove blood and air. Blood for transfusion and adequate intravenous access should be immediately available, because placement of the tube may disrupt hemostasis in the thoracic cavity and lead to exsanguination [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Persistent bleeding, major air leak, air embolism, and massive hemoptysis are indications for surgery.",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Traumatic asphyxia is a rare consequence of thoracic trauma that occurs in children because of the greater flexibility of their thoracic cages. Typically, a marked increase in intrathoracic pressure occurs as the result of direct compression of the chest from crushing injury, in conjunction with deep inspiration against a closed glottis. This increased pressure is transmitted from the right atrium directly through the valveless superior and inferior vena cava, causing rupture of venules and capillaries of the face and head [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The clinical manifestations include conjunctival hemorrhages, facial edema and cyanosis, and ecchymotic or petechial hemorrhages on the upper chest and face [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In severe cases, patients may have hemoptysis, bloody discharge from the nose",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    ears, and exophthalmos. Hemorrhage into the retina, vitreous body, or optic nerve can result in loss of vision. Associated neurologic symptoms include altered mental status, brachial plexus injuries, quadriplegia (without evidence of spinal cord injury), and coma [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Initial management should focus on support of airway, breathing, and circulation and treatment of related injuries. Interventions to reduce intracranial pressure (such as elevating the head of the bed) may be helpful. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?4/9/4250?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H14#H14\">",
"     \"Initial approach to severe traumatic brain injury in children\", section on 'Management'",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although the clinical manifestations of traumatic asphyxia are dramatic, morbidity and mortality are generally related to associated injuries. For children with traumatic asphyxia who survive the initial event, outcomes are generally good. The cutaneous findings and subconjunctival hemorrhages typically resolve and neurologic sequelae are rare [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/2\">",

"     1,7,8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Myocardial contusions account for as much as 95 percent of these injuries, with ventricular septal defects and papillary muscle rupture occurring uncommonly [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",

"   <p>",
"    Cardiac arrhythmia, a new murmur, heart failure, and hypotension are clinical features that suggest cardiac injury in patients with blunt thoracic trauma. However, these findings may be absent in many children. In one retrospective series describing children with blunt cardiac injuries, less than 25 percent of children had abnormal cardiac examinations [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The utility of cardiac troponin levels in the evaluation of children who have sustained blunt thoracic trauma is uncertain. Troponin levels may be elevated in patients with minor cardiac injury [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3495/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, those with normal troponin levels who are hemodynamically stable and have normal EKGs are unlikely to have significant myocardial injury. (See",

"   <p>",
"    Children with blunt cardiac injury (BCI) who are hemodynamically unstable, have elevated cardiac troponin levels, or abnormal EKGs should be admitted to the hospital for cardiac monitoring. Sequelae (such as mitral or tricuspid insufficiency or ventricular septal defect) may develop as the result of BCI. Consequently, all children with suspected BCI should receive close follow-up [",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Traumatic asphyxia is a rare consequence of thoracic trauma that occurs in children because of the greater flexibility of their thoracic cages. Dramatic physical findings include conjunctival hemorrhages, facial edema, and cyanosis. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Patients presenting with chest pain without evidence of an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may still have myocardial ischemia. In this setting, a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome&mdash; unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) &mdash; must be differentiated from noncardiac symptoms. This distinction is of crucial importance in patient triage and management in the emergency department. (See",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The role of acute rest rMPI in the early diagnosis of a possible ACS will be reviewed here. The cost-effectiveness of these tests will be presented and compared to other diagnostic and risk stratification strategies for CHD. The overall approach to the emergency department evaluation of suspected acute coronary ischemia and the role of rMPI for predischarge risk stratification in medically treated patients with a non-ST elevation ACS is discussed separately. (See",

"     RATIONALE FOR REST IMAGING",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is usually made in a setting of characteristic symptoms (chest pain or other symptoms that may be anginal), electrocardiographic abnormalities, and elevations in the serum concentrations of markers of cardiac injury. However, the use of these data alone in the initial evaluation does not always result in an accurate diagnosis. In various studies, 1.9 to 4 percent of patients with an ACS were mistakenly discharged from the emergency department [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3496/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]; such patients may have an increase in short-term mortality.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The frequency and causes of missed diagnosis were evaluated in a review of 10,689 patients who presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting acute coronary ischemia: 8 percent had an acute MI and 9 percent had UA [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3496/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Among the patients with an ACS, 2.2 percent were mistakenly discharged from the emergency department. Missed diagnosis was most often due to an atypical presentation. These patients were more likely to be women less than 55 years of age, to be nonwhite, to report shortness of breath as their major symptom, or to have a normal or nondiagnostic ECG. There was a nonsignificant trend toward an increased risk-adjusted 30-day mortality ratio for patients who were not hospitalized (1.9 and 1.7 in the patients with MI and UA, respectively).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Rest imaging tests, particularly rest radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) and echocardiography, may be of value in the evaluation of patients who have persistent chest pain suggestive of an ACS, a nondiagnostic ECG, and initially negative cardiac enzymes. Patients in whom the chest pain has resolved more often undergo stress testing. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?14/43/15034?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H28#H28\">",
"     \"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department\", section on 'Rest and stress imaging tests'",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    With acute rest rMPI with technetium (Tc)-99m sestamibi or Tc-99m tetrofosmin, the radiolabeled tracers accumulate in myocardial tissue in a degree proportional to myocardial blood flow. If these agents are injected during or shortly after resolution of chest pain, areas of ischemic myocardium demonstrate reduced radioactive counts (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62918 graphicRef80590 \" href=\"UTD.htm?4/8/4234\">",
"     image 1A-B",
"    </a>",
"    ). Because there is minimal redistribution of these agents over time, imaging can provide accurate information about myocardial perfusion at the time of injection even if the scintigraphy is delayed for a few hours after the injection. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/23/35192?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Basic properties of myocardial perfusion agents\"",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DETECTION OF ISCHEMIA",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Multiple studies have validated the use of acute rest rMPI in the emergency department evaluation of patients with chest pain suggestive of an ACS and a nondiagnostic ECG. Initial studies were performed with planar thallium-201 imaging techniques [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3496/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]; subsequent improvements have included the use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) techniques and Tc-99m sestamibi or tetrofosmin as the imaging agent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3496/abstract/4-9\">",
"     4-9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thallium, because of its property of rapid redistribution, does not have optimal imaging characteristics in the emergency department setting and is",
"    <strong>",
"     not",
"    </strong>",
"    recommended for use in acute rest rMPI. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?34/23/35192?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H2#H2\">",
"     \"Basic properties of myocardial perfusion agents\", section on 'Thallium-201'",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The value of rest imaging in identifying patients with ischemia was confirmed in a multicenter prospective trial in which Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT rMPI was performed in 357 patients who were admitted from the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia but with a nondiagnostic ECG [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3496/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Among 20 patients who had an acute MI, 18 had an abnormal scan (sensitivity 90 percent); the specificity was 60 percent. The reduced specificity was in part due to patients with positive scans who had coronary disease but no acute MI. Because so few patients had an MI, the positive predictive value was only 12 percent; however, the negative predictive value was 99 percent (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53835 \" href=\"UTD.htm?27/36/28237\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). It was suggested that using a normal SPECT scan as a criterion not to admit would result in a 57 percent reduction in hospital admissions in such patients.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Use in emergency department triage",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;These observations suggest that patients with normal images on acute rest rMPI can be safely discharged from the emergency department, resulting in a reduction in the number of unnecessary hospital admissions among patients who do not have an ACS.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The efficacy of this approach was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in which 2475 patients with suggestive chest pain within the previous three hours, a nondiagnostic ECG, and no prior MI were studied [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3496/abstract/9\">",
"     9",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) refers to a group of hematopoietic neoplasms involving cells committed to the lymphoid lineage. Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variant of ALL classified as ALL with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2);BCR-ABL1 in the WHO classification system [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3497/abstract/1\">",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    When treated with chemotherapy alone, patients with Ph+ ALL have a uniformly poor prognosis with few survivors at five years after treatment. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) provides better results, curing approximately 30 to 60 percent of patients with Ph+ ALL. The incorporation of a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (eg,",

"    ) into the treatment regimen has resulted in superior response rates, thereby allowing more patients to proceed to allo-HCT. It is not yet known whether treatment with chemotherapy plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor will provide durable long-term remissions and better survival than allo-HCT. The treatment of Ph+ ALL is distinct from that of other types of ALL and is comprised of several stages that, in total, may span three years of treatment (",

However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all of these patients will relapse within a few weeks or months despite continuing a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In contrast, patients who receive post-remission therapy may expect five-year survival rates of 40 to 60 percent.

The majority of studies that have evaluated this treatment approach were performed prior to the generalized incorporation of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into the induction regimen, a modification that has clearly affected the feasibility of post-remission HCT. With TKI-based induction, more patients enter remission in good clinical condition and are thus candidates for a curative transplant procedure.

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Dense deposit disease (DDD), also called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type II in the ultra-structural classification schema, is a rare form of glomerulonephritis that affects both children and young adults. The term \"dense deposit disease\" reflects the characteristic appearance of electron-dense material in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) observed on kidney biopsy (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73319 \" href=\"UTD.htm?24/19/24883\">",
"     picture 1",
"    </a>",
"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although DDD remains classified as a subgroup of the primary MPGN diseases (largely for historical reasons), it is considered by many to be a distinct entity [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3498/abstract/1-3\">",
"     1-3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. DDD is estimated to affect only two to three people per million [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3498/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This topic reviews the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment of DDD.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATHOGENESIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The major defect underlying dense deposit disease (DDD) is excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. This results in the deposition of multiple complement components in the glomerular basement membrane. The mechanism by which complement deposition leads to dense deposit formation or to the clinical manifestations of glomerulonephritis has not been established but most likely involves chemotaxis of leukocytes and possibly the cytolytic effects of C5b-9 (ie, the membrane attack complex of complement).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The alternative complement pathway is normally autoactivated by spontaneous cleavage of C3 to C3b, which leads to the formation of the C3 convertase by the binding of factor B and properdin (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59641 \" href=\"UTD.htm?13/7/13439\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). The C3 convertase, C3bBb, amplifies the cascade by enzymatically cleaving more C3 in addition to generating the downstream C5 convertase, C3bBbC3b. The C5 convertase cleaves C5 to the potent chemoattractant C5a and initiates assembly of C5b-9.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Normally, the activity of this pathway is tightly regulated and directly related to the activity of the C3 convertase (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59641 \" href=\"UTD.htm?13/7/13439\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). The serum protein, factor H, regulates the activity of the alternative pathway by directly promoting the decay of the C3 and C5 convertases. Factor H also combines with the regulator, factor I, to bind and rapidly inactivate free C3b. Complement pathways are reviewed in greater depth elsewhere. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/59/11190?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Complement pathways\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In patients with DDD, the activity of C3 convertase is increased by one or both of the following mechanisms:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Generation of a C3 convertase stabilizing autoantibody called C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) [",

"       4-7",
"      </a>",
"      ]. C3NeF is found in 80 percent of patients with DDD but is not unique to these patients [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3498/abstract/4-6,8,9\">",
"       4-6,8,9",
"      </a>",
"      ]. C3NeF has also been found in the serum of healthy individuals, those with meningococcal disease, and patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3498/abstract/1,9\">",
"       1,9",
"      </a>",
"      ]. C3 convertase stabilizing autoantibodies that bind factor B have been described [",

"       2,12-15",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Factor H normally inhibits the C3 convertase and activated C3 (C3b). The loss of functional factor H activity results from mutations or acquired defects of factor H [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3498/abstract/2,12-14\">",
"       2,12-14",
"      </a>",

"       15",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Although such defects are not commonly seen in patients with DDD, together with data from animal models, observations of such defects in patients established the role of unregulated alternate pathway activation in the pathogenesis of DDD. (See",

"      below.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      A study examining biopsy material of human kidneys with DDD showed that, in addition to C3, the deposits contain components of the terminal complement complex further supporting the additional role of the downstream components in the pathogenesis [",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Two brothers with DDD had low levels of factor H, C3, and factor B consistent with loss of inhibition of the alternative complement pathway.

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Mutations of factor H and factor I and the presence of autoantibodies to factor H have all been identified in patients who presented with atypical DDD, characterized by isolated C3 deposits on biopsy [",

"       15",
"      </a>",

"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It is possible that subtle differences in factor H levels or activity confer a risk for DDD since several allelic variants of the factor H gene and a closely related gene, factor H related 5 (CFHR5), have been associated with DDD [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?3/26/3498/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A genetic analysis of 66 patients with DDD demonstrated that compared with healthy controls, allelic variants of factor H or C3 genes increased the risk of developing the disease by up to twofold [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These reports provide compelling evidence of the role of factor H in the development of DDD in select cases. However, it is important to recognize that most patients with DDD do not have disease-causing mutations in the factor H or C3 genes [",

"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In addition, an acquired factor H deficiency may be causal in the pathogenesis of DDD in select patients, presumably due to the development of an inactivating auto-antibody to the factor H protein [",

"     <li>",
"      DDD is caused by uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway through various potential abnormalities in regulatory molecules, including absent or dysfunctional factor H or the presence of C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF). (See",

"    Schematic representation of the step-down protocol of gonadotropin administration, which is designed to bring about development of single follicles. This regimen mimics more closely the physiology of normal cycles. Therapy with FSH at a dose of 150 IU/day is started shortly after spontaneous or progesterone-induced bleeding and continued until a dominant follicle (&gt;10 mm) is seen on transvaginal ultrasonography. The dose is then decreased to 112.5 IU/day followed by a further decrease to 75 IU/day, which is continued until human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is administered to induce ovulation.",

"    Schematic showing a proposed model for the oxygen sensor mechanism of erythropoiesis. Under hypoxic conditions (upper left), both the alpha and beta subunits of HIF-1 are stabilized, leading to subsequent erythropoietin (Epo) gene transcription via the aggregate effects of hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4, p300, and HIF-1-alpha and -beta. The Epo, once formed, binds to Epo receptors on committed erythroid precursor cells. Under normoxic conditions (upper middle), only the beta unit of HIF-1 is fully expressed. The alpha unit undergoes proline hydroxylation (PH) in the presence of iron and oxygen. When hydroxylated HIF-1-alpha binds to the Von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), a ubiquitin ligase complex (UL) is activated, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of HIF-1-alpha via the proteasome, preventing the subsequent transcription of Epo. Mutations affecting proteins along this pathway have been associated with congenital erythrocytosis.",
