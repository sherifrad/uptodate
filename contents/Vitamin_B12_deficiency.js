"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Presents with macrocytic anaemia and is difficult to differentiate from vitamin B12 deficiency initially.MDS is a group of disorders characterised by a clonal chromosomal abnormality, ineffective and dysplastic haematopoiesis resulting in &ge;1 cytopenias, and a varying predilection to develop acute myeloid leukaemia.These disorders either can arise primarily without any precipitating event or may be related to previous treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC in MDS shows normochromic or macrocytic red cells; about 40% of patients have neutropenia, and &gt;30% have thrombocytopenia. Morphological abnormalities are found such as oval macrocytic red cells and granulocytes with the pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly (hypogranular and hypolobulated granulocytes).Bone marrow histopathology in MDS demonstrates dysplasia in a proportion of undifferentiated myeloblasts.Prussian blue iron staining of bone marrow aspirate can show ringed sideroblasts (abnormal erythroid precursor cells that have granules around the nucleus).</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section4'>Peripheral neuropathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Compression neuropathies and neuropathies due to diabetes or thyroid disease may be difficult to differentiate from neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Nerve conduction studies and EMG are helpful in confirming neuropathy and characterising the neuropathy; that is, demyelinating, axonal, polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex, radiculopathy, or plexopathy.Treatment with vitamin B12 may improve symptoms, but neuropathy may also be irreversible.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section5'>Diabetic neuropathy</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section5'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Paraesthesia is a common feature and may occur in the extremities as a result of neuropathy in those with prolonged undiagnosed diabetes. Other types of neuropathy may be present in diabetes, including autonomic neuropathy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, islet cell antibodies, and insulin auto-antibodies are present in 85% of patients with type 1 diabetes at the time of diagnosis, but may disappear within a few years.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section7'>Dementia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by cognitive (memory) changes, psychiatric symptoms, personality changes, problem behaviours, and changes in day-to-day functioning.May be due to multiple different factors that are clinically indistinguishable from vitamin B12 deficiency.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> A mental state examination or neuropsychiatric testing should be conducted if the diagnosis is uncertain.Vitamin B12 testing is normal.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section8'>Depression</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section8'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Characterised by persistent low mood causing varying levels of social, cognitive, occupational, and physical dysfunction.Depression is diagnosed clinically with a finding of &gt;5 of the following symptoms, present during the same 2-week period: depressed mood, anhedonia, weight changes, libido changes, sleep disturbance, psychomotor problems, low energy, excessive guilt, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Vitamin B12 testing is normal.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section9'>Pernicious anaemia (PA)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section9'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients present with symptoms of anaemia and vitamin B12 deficiency. They may also have fever and complain of gastric pain or discomfort. Common features include tiredness, dyspnoea, paraesthesia, sore red tongue, diarrhoea, and mild jaundice.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Once vitamin B12 deficiency is confirmed, antiparietal cell (APC) antibody can determine whether PA is the cause.Highly sensitive (85%), but not specific. Can be elevated in atrophic gastritis.Once patient is given intrinsic factor, and vitamin B12 level is normal, gastrin levels will normalise.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section12'>Peptic ulcer disease from Helicobacter pylori infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section12'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> H pylori is a gram-negative, micro-aerophile bacterium that inhabits the stomach and duodenum. It causes a chronic low-level atrophic gastritis and is strongly linked to the development of duodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer.Over 80% of people infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The carbon urea breath test is positive.The most reliable method for detecting H pylori infection is endoscopic biopsy. Histopathology shows gastric atrophy, inflammation, and bacterial organisms on special stains.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section13'>Chronic pancreatitis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section13'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of gallstone disease or alcohol misuse.Characterised by recurrent or persistent abdominal pain and progressive injury to the pancreas and surrounding structures, resulting in scarring and loss of function.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Ultrasound or CT imaging of the abdomen may reveal fibrosis and calcification of the pancreas.Evaluation of pancreatic enzymes is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing mild-to-moderate pancreatic insufficiency or chronic pancreatitis, but it is available in only a few centres. Pancreatic juice is collected with a gastroduodenal tube during exogenous hormone stimulation with cholecystokinin and/or secretin.Helps differentiate pancreatic from non-pancreatic types of malabsorption.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section15'>Zollinger-Ellison syndrome</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section15'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> A condition caused by a gastrin-secreting tumour that causes hypersecretion of gastric acid leading to ulcer disease. It most commonly presents with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Less common presentations include weight loss, GI bleeding, nausea, and vomiting.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Elevated level of fasting serum gastrin in the absence of achlorhydria, and either a positive secretion test or histologically demonstrated neuroendocrine tumour.</p>",

"<dd id='Section17'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fish tapeworm is native to Scandinavia, western Russia, and the Baltic states, though it is now also present in North America, especially the Pacific North-west.Infection arises following eating raw fish or fish products.Patients present with symptoms of malnutrition including anaemia.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Tapeworm eggs appear in the faeces 5 to 6 weeks after infection, and faecal examination may confirm the diagnosis.</p>",
"</dd>",
"<dt><a href='#Section18'>HIV infection</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section18'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Malnutrition is common in HIV disease, particularly in resource-poor areas. A cycle of opportunistic infection causing loss of weight and poor appetite, together with diarrhoea and malabsorption, contributes to this malnutrition.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> ELISA testing should be ordered when HIV testing is indicated. False-negatives may occur during the window period immediately after infection and before antibodies to HIV have developed. A positive result should be confirmed with a Western blot or second ELISA. The window period can be reduced to 2 to 4 weeks by using fourth-generation tests and those that include IgM antibodies to HIV.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section19'>Alpha-thalassaemia</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section19'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> An inherited autosomal-recessive blood disease.Vitamin B12 requirement is increased in alpha-thalassaemia and, in these patients, vitamin B12 deficiency may be the presenting feature. Patients present with anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, and bone pain. This disease is more common in Mediterranean countries, Asia, the Middle East, and South America.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> FBC and peripheral smear show microcytosis, erythrocytosis, hypochromia, and mild anaemia.The diagnosis is made by a combination of family studies and the ruling out of both iron-deficiency anaemia and beta-thalassaemia trait.Haemoglobin electrophoresis shows increased ratios of beta- to alpha-globin chains.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section20'>Multiple sclerosis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section20'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Neurological manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency can mimic clinical symptoms of multiple sclerosis. However, in almost all cases of multiple sclerosis there are also brain lesions.Variable presentation: multiple episodes separated by space (i.e., neurological symptoms result from lesions in different CNS sites) and time. Symptoms include progressive limb weakness, gait difficulty, ataxia, loss of balance, and paroxysmal vertigo.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Brain MRI typically shows areas of demyelination.CSF examination shows raised IgG and oligoclonal banding.</p>",

"<dd id='Section21'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of syphilis infection or sexually transmitted infection.Neurological symptoms of tabes dorsalis and sub-acute combined spinal degeneration may be similar.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The VDRL reaction alone cannot always be depended on in differential diagnosis, as false-positive reactions are not uncommon in lepromatous leprosy, in which case PCR test may be more sensitive and specific.CSF examination is required to diagnose neurosyphilis.CSF VDRL reactivity test is specific but not sensitive for neurosyphilis.CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) reactivity test is sensitive, but not specific for neurosyphilis.</p>",
