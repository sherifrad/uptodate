"    Standing anteroposterior films of both lower extremities help distinguish physiologic bowing from pathologic causes. Tibial metaphyseal-diaphyseal (MD) angles are typically 11 degrees or less. A similar angle constructed in the distal femur is the same or greater, indicating that the femur and tibia contribute similarly to the bowing. The ratio of femoral to tibial MD angle is greater than 1.",

"       What is bronchiectasis?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that causes a cough, breathing problems, and other symptoms. It makes the airways (the branching tubes that carry air within the lungs) get wider and weaker (",
"      <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/17/41237\">",
"       figure 1",
"      </a>",
"      ). This makes it hard to clear mucus out of the lungs. When mucus stays in the lungs, it makes people with bronchiectasis more likely to get frequent lung infections.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Bronchiectasis has many different causes. These include certain infections or problems with the body&rsquo;s infection-fighting system (called the &ldquo;immune system&rdquo;). Diseases that can cause bronchiectasis include cystic fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis.",

"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Sharp chest pain &ndash; Chest pain is not common with bronchiectasis, but it can happen. The pain tends to get worse when you take a breath.",

"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Chest physiotherapy &ndash; This involves loosening the mucus in the lungs so you can cough it up more easily. There is more than 1 way to do this. Your doctor or nurse can show you the different ways.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Treatment to stop bleeding in the airways &ndash; Coughing up a lot of blood can be life threatening. Doctors can do a procedure called &ldquo;bronchial artery embolization&rdquo; to help stop the bleeding. During this procedure, the doctor puts a thin tube into an artery in the leg and moves it up to the lungs. Then he or she uses tiny tools to block the artery in the bleeding area.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Pulmonary rehabilitation&nbsp;&ndash; This is called &ldquo;pulmonary rehab&rdquo; for short. In pulmonary rehab, people learn to improve their symptoms in new ways. They learn exercises and ways to breathe that can help ease symptoms.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Surgery &ndash; If part of a lung is damaged or keeps getting infected, doctors might do surgery to remove it.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        A lung transplant &ndash; This is surgery in which a doctor replaces a person&rsquo;s diseased lungs with healthy lungs. A lung transplant is done only in people who have severe disease and meet certain conditions.",

Patients who develop hypertriglyceridemia (eg, &gt;500 mg/dL) are at risk of developing pancreatitis. A reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids may be necessary.

"      INTRODUCTION",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Pediatric vaccine programs in the United States have been extremely successful against a range of contagious diseases, including measles, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis; fewer than 500 children die in the US each year of vaccine preventable diseases.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     However, healthy adults also require regular vaccines. As many as 50,000 to 70,000 adults die annually of pneumonia and influenza in the United States, which could be greatly reduced with vaccinations. Receiving appropriate immunizations plays a crucial role in protecting health throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The following is a general discussion of vaccines currently recommended for healthy adults. Separate articles discuss vaccines for international travelers and children. (See",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_basics\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?20/44/21187?source=see_link\">",

"      HOW DO VACCINES WORK?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The immune system protects the body against illness and infection. When a person's immune system recognizes a foreign organism (bacterium, virus), it responds by creating proteins called antibodies. Antibodies fight the infection and help the person to recover.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Antibodies also work to prevent a person from becoming ill in the future. The next time a person is exposed to the organism, the immune system recognizes it and rapidly produces the antibodies required to destroy the organism. This response protects the individual from developing the disease, ideally for life. For example, a person who had chickenpox as a child is unlikely to develop it again, even if he or she is in close contact with a person who is infected.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. However, unlike bacteria and viruses, vaccines do not cause the person to become ill in order to develop these antibodies. There are two main types of immunizations: active and passive.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H3\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Active vaccines",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Active vaccines use a weakened form of the harmful bacteria or virus or components of the bacteria or virus to stimulate the immune system. Some active vaccines are called live vaccines because they are made from a weakened form of the bacterium or virus.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Some bacteria (eg, diphtheria, tetanus) cause illness because they produce a harmful substance in the body called toxins. Vaccines that help the immune system protect the body from toxins are called toxoids. Toxoids are made from weakened forms of the toxins of bacteria.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H4\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Passive vaccines",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Passive vaccines provide temporary immunity with antibodies obtained from a large pool of donors; this preparation is known as immune serum globulin. Passive vaccines offer short-term protection to children or adults who have been exposed to a specific organism.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H5\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Vaccines protect children and adults",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Many people are concerned about the risks of vaccines. However, vaccines have a long record of being a safe and effective way of preventing disease. In most cases, the benefits of vaccinating are much greater than the potential risks. Diseases such as diphtheria and measles are uncommon in developed countries such as the United States. However, these illnesses are still common in developing countries.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     It is easy for illness to spread to children or adults who are not vaccinated because immigrants and visitors can travel from affected areas. Vaccines help to reduce a child's, family's, and even an entire community's chances of becoming ill by decreasing the number of people who become sick and transmit the infection to other people. This process is sometimes referred to as \"herd immunity.\"",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     An example of a successful vaccine program is smallpox. Before a vaccine was available, smallpox killed millions of people every year. As a result of an intensive vaccination program, smallpox has been completely eliminated throughout the world.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H6\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      How are vaccines given?",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Most immunizations are given to adults in the form of an injection into the upper arm. Some vaccines are also given in other ways, such as by mouth or as a nasal spray.",

"      VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Most vaccines are safe and cause few if any serious side effects. Very rarely, serious side effects do occur. People who are vaccinated and then develop symptoms that could be related to the vaccine should contact their healthcare provider. There is a national Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS,",
"     <a class=\"external\" href=\"file://vaers.hhs.gov/index\">",
"      file://vaers.hhs.gov/index",
"     </a>",
"     , telephone number 1-800-822-7967), which can be consulted if necessary. Occasionally, recommendations for a vaccine are changed in response to this type of report.",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Mild side effects",

"      <li>",
"       A mild fever",

"       A reddish, tender area at the site of injection",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Occasionally, a \"serum sickness-like\" reaction that may be characterized by fever, skin rash, swollen lymph nodes, joint pain,",

"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Severe side effects",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Severe side effects of vaccines are rare, but may include a severe neurologic reaction (eg, seizures) or severe allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis). Allergic reactions usually occur within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine. If this occurs in the healthcare provider's office, emergency care can be given immediately. If a severe reaction occurs later, the person or a family member should call emergency medical services, available in most areas of the United States by calling 911.",

"      <li>",
"       Patients who have recently received a blood transfusion or immune serum globulin, which can delay the normal response to active vaccination. In this case, the vaccination should be delayed for one month.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant within the next 28 days, due to the potential risk of the vaccine to the developing fetus.",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     In some cases, there is an alternative vaccine that is not live that can be used. For example, the injectable form of the influenza vaccine is not live and is recommended for those who cannot receive live vaccines, such as pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     In addition, most infants visit a healthcare provider frequently during the first year, which improves the chances of completing most vaccines that require multiple doses.

Adults aged 65 years or older who are healthcare workers or who have close contact with infants under one year of age (eg, grandparents, childcare providers) should get a single dose of Tdap as soon as they can, regardless of how long ago they had a tetanus booster. Adults over age 65 who do not have close contact with infants can also receive a single dose of Tdap. If the booster dose is overdue and there is concern that the person was exposed to tetanus, tetanus immune globulin is given along with the Td or Tdap.

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The inability of the clinician to directly visualize the fistula or abscess makes it difficult to assess the lesions. The physician must essentially discern the perianal anatomy by touch. This task is made even more problematic by the induration and inflammation that is usually present in these patients. Even surgical evaluation is only 35 to 85 percent accurate when compared to the results of other diagnostic tests and clinical evaluation [",

"    The importance of accurately characterizing the perianal process prior to embarking on therapy cannot be overemphasized. The risk of incomplete healing, a recurrent fistula, or even inadvertent sphincter injury is increased if fistula anatomy is incorrectly delineated or an occult abscess missed. An imaging modality should ideally provide a virtual road map that the physician can use to plan therapy. This is especially true with fistulas that involve a significant portion of the anal sphincter complex. Such patients are at the greatest risk of developing incontinence from the destructive fistulizing process or from overly aggressive surgical treatment.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Thus, patients with simple fistulas that only involve a small portion or none of the external anal sphincter generally do well with either medical or surgical treatment. Imaging of the fistula is helpful in determining the type of fistula to guide treatment but is not always needed. By contrast, for patients with a complex fistula (ie, one that involves a significant portion of the sphincter complex), preoperative imaging is mandatory.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Several imaging modalities are available to evaluate perianal fistulas and abscesses. These include fistulography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography (both transrectal and endoscopic). The efficacy of each modality (with emphasis on endoscopic ultrasonography) will be reviewed here.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Fistulography has traditionally been the primary method of evaluating perianal fistulas. It involves insertion of a small caliber catheter into the external opening of a fistula and injection of radiographic contrast material directly into the fistula track. Radiographs from different angles are then obtained.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Fistulography has several drawbacks. The crucial determination of the fistula's course in relation to the sphincter complex must be inferred because the musculature of the anorectum cannot be visualized. In addition, instillation of the contrast material can be painful and can lead to the theoretical dissemination of septic fistulous contents.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Furthermore, the accuracy of fistulography has been questioned. In one retrospective study of 25 patients, the findings of fistulography were compared to the operative findings [",

In addition, as the authors readily admit, the rigid nature of the probe prevented good acoustic coupling higher in the rectum, thus preventing the interpretation of higher fistula tracks. Furthermore, the focal length of the probe utilized for this study was only 3 cm, which limited scanning to no deeper than the external anal sphincter (EAS). To prevent these problems, we use an inflatable balloon probe on a flexible echoendoscope to permit better acoustic coupling throughout the rectum. In addition, we evaluate the fistulas with both radial and linear scanning instruments in order to achieve a greater depth of imaging and to more thoroughly characterize the fistulas.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Babesiosis is an infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus Babesia. Babesia protozoa infect vertebrate animals and cause lysis of host red blood cells. The zoonotic cycle is maintained by tick vectors. Human infection is accidental; humans are not definitive reservoir hosts. Babesiosis may also be acquired by blood transfusion, particularly in areas endemic for B. microti and B. duncani.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The main etiologic agents of human babesiosis are B. microti in the northern and midwestern regions of the United States, and B. divergens in Europe [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?38/25/39321/abstract/1\">",
"     1",

"    ]. Other Babesia species are occasionally but rarely identified in humans (eg, B. divergens-like organisms in the Midwest and on the west coast of the United States; B. duncani on the west coast of the United States; and B. venatorum in Europe).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Treatment modalities depend on the species of Babesia and the immune status of the host. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of babesiosis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection are discussed separately. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;B. microti is the predominant species in North America. Manifestations of infection due to this species range from mild to severe, sometimes resulting in death.

"      Babesiosis is an infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus Babesia. Babesia protozoa infect vertebrate animals and cause lysis of host red blood cells. The zoonotic cycle is maintained by tick vectors. Human infection is accidental; humans are not definitive reservoir hosts. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H1\">",
"       'Introduction'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Clinical manifestations of Babesia infection range from asymptomatic to severe infection (sometimes fatal). Symptoms of mild illness typically include fever, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and anorexia. Severe illness may include manifestations of brisk hemolysis (jaundice, hemoglobinuria) as well as multiorgan system failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive failure, and renal failure). (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Clinical manifestations'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The severity of infection depends on the Babesia species and the immune status of the host. B. microti is the predominant species in North America; manifestations of infection due to this species range from mild (in young healthy individuals) to severe (in immunocompromised patients and in the elderly). B. divergens is the predominant species in Europe; nearly all symptomatic cases attributed to B. divergens have occurred among asplenic individuals. (See",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",

"      The goal for treatment of ITP is to provide a safe platelet count to prevent major bleeding, rather than correcting the underlying disease. A critical concept is to avoid unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. (See",

"     <li>",
"      ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. Every effort should be made to rule out other conditions that might present as isolated thrombocytopenia (eg, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, myelodysplastic syndrome, congenital thrombocytopenias). (See",

"    Normal urine contains small amounts of albumin, low-molecular-weight serum proteins, and proteins derived from renal tubules and the lower urinary tract. Albuminuria and proteinuria can be measured using excretion rates in timed urine collections, ratio of concentrations to creatinine concentration in spot urine samples, and semiquantitative dipsticks in spot urine samples. Relationships among measurement methods within a category are not exact.",
"    <br/>",
"    Normal albumin and protein excretion rates are &lt;10 mg/day and &lt;50 mg/day, respectively. In most kidney diseases, albumin is the predominant urine protein, comprising approximately 60 to 90 percent of urine protein when protein excretion rate is very high. Urine albumin excretion rate of 30 to 300 and &gt;300 mg/day correspond to moderately increased albuminuria (formerly \"microalbuminuria\") and severely increased albuminuria (formerly \"macroalbuminuria\"), respectively. Urine albumin and protein excretion rates of &gt;2200 mg/day and &gt;3500 mg/day are usually accompanied by signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome (hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and edema).",
"    <br/>",
"    Albuminuria and proteinuria may be assessed from ACR and PCR. ACR and PCR are best determined by repeated measurement in morning first voided urine. In general, for clinical decision-making, ACR and PCR are sufficient, but AER and PER can be measured as a confirmatory test. Relationships between AER and ACR and between PER and PCR are based on the assumption that average creatinine excretion rate is 1 g/day. Creatinine excretion varies with age, sex, race and diet; therefore, the relationship among these categories is approximate only. ACR &lt;10 mg/g (&lt;1.1 mg/mmol) is considered normal; ACR 10 to 29 mg/g (1.1 to 3.3 mg/mmol) is considered \"mildly increased.\"",
"    <br/>",
"    Proteinuria may be assessed from semiquantitative urine dipsticks. The relationship between urine dipstick results and other measures depends upon urine concentration. In particular, a \"trace\" result can correspond to the \"normal to mildly increased\" category or low range of the \"moderately increased\" category. Positive dipstick tests can be confirmed by ACR, PCR, AER, or PER.",
