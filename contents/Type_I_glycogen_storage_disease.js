"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Differentiating features for GSD III include growth retardation. About 70% of patients have muscle weakness, but this is usually not clinically significant in childhood.Hypoglycaemia is common, but is not always present, and is usually less severe than in GSD I. Patients may be able to tolerate longer periods of fasting than those with GSD I.Infants may be asymptomatic with a typical schedule of frequent feedings and do not become as severely ill with infections and other stressors that disrupt feeding as do children with GSD I.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plasma cholesterol, creatine kinase (CK) concentrations, and urinary ketones should be measured early in childhood to distinguish from GSD I.Elevations in AST and ALT are usually higher (may be &gt;1000 units/L) than in GSD I.Mutation analysis is now the preferred method used to establish a specific diagnosis for this disease.</p>",

"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients with GSD VI (glycogen phosphorylase deficiency) and GSD IX (phosphorylase kinase deficiency) are often clinically indistinguishable.Hypoglycaemia is not as severe as in GSD I or GSD III, and so symptomatic hypoglycaemia during infancy is uncommon unless there is a prolonged fast, which may be associated with hyperketosis.Metabolic acidosis is rare.Common presenting symptoms are an enlarged liver and distended abdomen noted during a physical examination.Physical growth may be impaired during childhood and onset of puberty is frequently delayed, but catch-up growth results in normal adult height.Clinical and biochemical abnormalities gradually ameliorate, and most adult patients are asymptomatic.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Hypoglycaemia and uric acid levels are usually normal, as is blood lactate (though lactate levels are elevated in patients with a specific mutation in the gamma subunit).Hypercholesterolaemia may occur, and ketosis occurs with fasting.After an overnight fast, blood lactate level is normal and administration of glucagon elicits a brisk glycaemic response without a rise in the blood lactate concentration.A diagnosis of GSD VI or IX can be established by assaying the activity of phosphorylase in purified blood cell fractions: muscle phosphorylase activity, muscle histology, and glycogen content are normal.Mutation analysis is now the preferred method used to establish a specific diagnosis for these diseases.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Glycogen storage disease type XI (GSD XI)</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> GSD XI (Fanconi-Bickel syndrome) is an extremely rare disorder caused by a deficiency in the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT-2 that has an essential role in the liver, pancreas, intestine, and kidney.Patients usually present in infancy with symptoms of hypoglycaemia as the interval between meals increases.Differentiating signs and symptoms include hypophosphataemic rickets and a Fanconi-like tubulopathy, which are characteristic features.Many patients have short stature and may have chronic diarrhoea from carbohydrate malabsorption.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Fasting ketotic hypoglycaemia and postprandial hyperglycaemia are essential distinguishing features, developing due to impaired hepatic uptake of glucose and disordered insulin secretion.Other laboratory findings include glucosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia, hypergalactosaemia, generalised aminoaciduria, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.Mutation analysis of the GLUT-2 gene confirms a diagnosis of GSD XI.</p>",

"<dd id='Section3'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Fructose 1-6-bisphosphatase deficiency is an extremely rare gluconeogenesis disorder that shares many clinical and laboratory features with GSD I.Some infants present with recurrent hypoglycaemia and severe lactic acidosis in the first month of life.Hypoglycaemia occurs between feedings, with prolonged fasting or intercurrent illness.Hepatomegaly develops due to fatty infiltration and is not due to glycogen accumulation.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The biochemical abnormalities are similar to those in GSD I, but in contrast to GSD I, when glucagon administration is performed in the fed state it elicits a brisk glycaemic response.Although genetic testing is available, leukocyte analysis or liver biopsy is often required for diagnosis.</p>",
