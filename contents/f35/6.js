"       What is a Baker&rsquo;s cyst?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A Baker&rsquo;s cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind the knee (",
"      <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87131 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?3/58/4003\">",
"       figure 1",
"      </a>",
"      ). This cyst can cause symptoms, such as pain or knee stiffness. The medical term for a Baker&rsquo;s cyst is &ldquo;popliteal cyst.&rdquo;",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500668\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What are the symptoms of a Baker&rsquo;s cyst?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Baker&rsquo;s cysts do not always cause symptoms. When they do, the symptoms can include:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        Pain in the back of the knee",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Knee stiffness",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Swelling or a bulge at the back of the knee, especially when the leg is straight",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      People often find that their symptoms get worse if they stand for a long time or bend their knee too far. Symptoms and swelling sometimes also get worse with activity.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      In some cases, Baker&rsquo;s cysts tear open and leak their fluid onto nearby tissues. If that happens, symptoms can include calf swelling and redness, or bruising below the knee.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500683\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Should I see a doctor or nurse?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yes, if you have the symptoms described above, see your doctor or nurse. Not all swelling behind the knee is due to a Baker&rsquo;s cyst. Your doctor or nurse can look at your knee and talk to you about your symptoms to decide what to do next.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500698\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Will I need tests?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Probably not. If you have a Baker&rsquo;s cyst, your doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell just by doing an exam. But if he or she is not sure, you might need an imaging test, such as an X-ray or an ultrasound. (An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of your body.)",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178500713\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       How is a Baker&rsquo;s cyst treated?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The main treatment is an injection of steroid medicines directly into the knee. These steroids are not the same ones athletes take to build muscle. These steroids reduce swelling and inflammation.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      If treatment with steroids medicines does not work, other (much less used) options include:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        Draining the cyst with a needle",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Surgery to remove the cyst",

"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Maybe. Your doctor or nurse might suggest resting the knee and taking medicines called &ldquo;NSAIDs&rdquo; for 1 to 2 weeks before he or she orders an imaging test or suggests a knee injection. Some examples of NSAIDs include",

"       What is stress-induced cardiomyopathy?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Stress-induced cardiomyopathy is a heart condition that causes sudden chest pain. It happens most often in older women. Most of the time, it is triggered by a sudden medical illness, intense emotion, or other stress (such as the death of a loved one). This condition is also sometimes called &ldquo;broken heart syndrome&rdquo; or &ldquo;takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&rdquo;",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      In stress-induced cardiomyopathy, part of the heart stops working normally and the heart doesn&rsquo;t pump well. In most cases, the lower end of the heart is involved. When this happens, this part of the heart gets bigger. Because of this, stress-induced cardiomyopathy is sometimes called &ldquo;apical ballooning syndrome.&rdquo;",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Even though this condition causes similar symptoms as a heart attack, it is different from a heart attack. A heart attack happens most often in people with coronary heart disease (also called coronary artery disease). In a heart attack, 1 of the arteries that supply blood to the heart gets blocked. This causes part of the heart muscle to be damaged.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      People with stress-induced cardiomyopathy do not usually have coronary heart disease. They usually have only very little heart damage.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Stress-induced cardiomyopathy is usually not long-lasting. Most people get completely better in 1 to 4 weeks. But sometimes stress-induced cardiomyopathy leads to serious heart problems, such as:",

"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yes. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Because the symptoms of stress-induced cardiomyopathy are the same as those of a heart attack, your doctor will order tests to find out what&rsquo;s causing your symptoms.",

"       How is stress-induced cardiomyopathy treated?",

"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Most people are treated with medicines. Your doctor can prescribe different heart medicines, depending on your symptoms and the problems caused by your cardiomyopathy.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      People usually take these medicines for a short time only, until their condition improves. But some people need to take medicines for the rest of their life.",

"     <p>",
"      Most people with stress-induced cardiomyopathy get better within 1 to 4 weeks and do not get this condition again. But people who have had stress-induced cardiomyopathy sometimes get the condition again.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Coccydynia (pain in the coccyx, sometimes called coccygodynia, or pain in the tailbone) is a common, painful condition that is easily diagnosed. Though coccydynia usually resolves over weeks to months with supportive care, it is sometimes protracted and debilitating.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Prolonged symptoms may lead to aggressive diagnostic tests and interventions that are not supported by strong research evidence of effectiveness. Most publications on coccydynia are case reports, case series, and reviews, and there are few rigorous research studies.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     ANATOMY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The coccyx projects distal to the sacrum, curving posteriorly and then anteriorly at the tip (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52932 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?28/3/28722\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). It is exposed to blunt trauma posteriorly and juts into the birth canal in women, and so can be injured during childbirth. The coccyx, along with the two ischial tuberosities, bears weight when a person is sitting, with an increased weight load on the coccyx when a person leans back in the sitting position (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59325 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?30/51/31537\">",
"     figure 2",
"    </a>",
"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The coccyx typically has 3 to 5 segments, with fibrocartilaginous joints between sacrum and coccyx and between segments. These joints are comparable to those seen in higher intervertebral spaces, but may be fused in the coccyx. Muscles and ligaments that insert on the sacrum and coccyx (the levator ani and its component parts) support the pelvic floor and participate in voluntary control of the bowel.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The rate of coccydynia in the general population has not been reported. A busy primary care practitioner might see a few new cases per year. Intractable coccydynia is uncommon; few referral physicians have a primary interest in, or extensive experience with, the syndrome.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Coccydynia most commonly occurs in adolescents and adults [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ], although children are sometimes affected. Coccydynia is five times more prevalent in women than men, partly due to trauma during a vaginal delivery [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Also, it is thought that the coccyx is more posterior in women and so more susceptible to trauma. Obesity is a risk factor, apparently by changing the way people sit [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     ETIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Coccydynia is a syndrome with many causes [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/4,5\">",
"     4,5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The most common cause is direct external trauma from a fall backwards into a sitting position, in which the coccyx is bruised, broken, or dislocated. This may lead to inflammation and spasm of the surrounding muscles.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Other causes include:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Repetitive minor trauma &mdash; from prolonged sitting, especially with poor posture, on a hard or ill-fitting surface (eg, during air or car travel) or a narrow surface (bicycle riding) (",
"      <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59325 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?30/51/31537\">",
"       figure 2",
"      </a>",
"      ). This is also exacerbated by inflammation and muscle spasm.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Injury in childbirth &mdash; caused by posterior pressure exerted from the birth canal [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/6\">",
"       6",
"      </a>",
"      ].",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Degenerative joint changes &mdash; Although such changes are common on radiographs, similar to findings on lumbar spine x-rays, it is not clear whether x-ray findings correlate with symptoms of pain.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Somatization &mdash; Depression, and pending litigation, may affect how coccygeal pain is experienced, as it does for other injuries.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Uncommon causes, described in case reports and small case series, include metastatic cancers, calcium crystal deposits in the sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal joints, chordomas (often presenting with cauda equina symptoms in addition to pain), posterior spicules, benign notochordal cell tumors, avascular necrosis, arachnoiditis of the sacral nerves, glomus tumor, and precoccygeal dermoid cyst.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DIAGNOSIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pain and tenderness are well localized to the coccyx. Patients complain of pain in the tailbone on sitting, especially when leaning back, and pain on rising and with prolonged standing. Defecation and sexual intercourse may also be painful. The pain may radiate to the floor of the pelvis, mimicking prostatitis or pelvic inflammatory disease.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Diagnosis is confirmed by rectal examination. The coccyx can be grasped between the thumb and forefinger and is tender and painful on movement, while adjacent structures are not tender. The sacro-coccygeal joint is usually mobile, with a normal range of about 13 degrees [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. There should be no signs of inflammation other than pain and tenderness.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Disorders affecting structures in the same region can mimic coccydynia and should be ruled out. Pilonidal sinus infection involves subcutaneous pain, redness, warmth, and swelling over the coccyx, often with a visible sinus and purulent drainage. Proctalgia fugax refers to attacks of fleeting pain in the rectum without gross pathology. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?15/47/16118?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Proctalgia fugax\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Pain may be referred to the coccyx from diseases of the spine and pelvic organs. Spinal pathology, such as lumbar disk disease, may coexist with coccydynia, and may mimic its pain. However, spinal disease alone does not cause coccygeal tenderness, the hallmark of coccydynia.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MANAGEMENT",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Most cases resolve either without medical care or with conservative management; few patients go on to require specialized care. Coccydynia associated with acute trauma is more likely to resolve than symptoms that develop insidiously and without obvious cause.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Acute coccydynia",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Initial management is with protection, analgesics, and heat or ice. While it is not possible to put the injured part at rest, patients can protect their coccyx while sitting by leaning forward so that weight is mainly borne on the ischial tuberosities.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    \"Donut\" cushions (pillows with a hole in the center) or \"wedge\" cushions (with a wedge-shaped section cut out of the back) distribute weight away from the coccyx. Many styles of wedge and donut cushions are sold in pharmacies or on the web. Patients can also make one, by cutting a wedge out of the back of a 2 to 4 inch foam rubber cushion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It is unclear whether heat or cold applications are preferable; patients should try both and let their symptoms be their guide. Many reviews recommend anti-inflammatory drugs, but there is no research evidence or pathologic rationale for effectiveness beyond their analgesic properties. Coccydynia may be protracted and opioid analgesics should be avoided except in instances of severe pain related to acute trauma.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Diagnostic radiographs are not useful in acute coccydynia, unless there is reason to suspect specific pathology such as infection or cancer. In the absence of concern about these conditions, the significance of radiographic findings is often uncertain and results from radiographs do not change acute management.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Patients should be told that symptoms resolve in most cases, although resolution may occur over weeks or even months, more slowly than most patients expect and want.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Chronic coccydynia",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A minority of patients develop chronic coccydynia. These patients are often referred to specialists in pain management (physical medicine and rehabilitation or anesthesiology), or orthopedic surgeons. An algorithm for therapeutic decision-making and treatment in persistent cases, from the point of view of a pain specialist, has been published [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\">",
"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Radiologic diagnosis",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In patients with persistent symptoms, lateral coccygeal radiographs and MRIs may show fractures, degenerative changes, or (rarely) tumors. Comparison of lateral radiographs standing and sitting in the most painful position can show an abnormal degree of mobility (eg, &gt;25 degrees in the sitting position) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35940/abstract/3\">",
"     3",

"     Local injection",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Some consultants inject coccygeal structures, guided by fluoroscopy, with either local anesthetic or local anesthetic plus corticosteroids. Injections may be directed at the sacrococcygeal junction, the caudal epidural space, or the ganglion impar, a midline sympathetic ganglion located just anterior to the sacro-coccygeal junction.

"     12",
"    </a>",

In a randomized trial of patients with chronic (&gt;2 months) coccydynia, selected because of abnormal coccygeal mobility, scores for pain and functional impact were more likely to improve for the manipulated group than the placebo group (36 versus 20 percent), but neither group had a large improvement [",

While not studied specifically for coccydynia, acupuncture has benefit for patients with nonspecific low back pain and other chronic pain syndromes, and might be a reasonable option for patients with coccydynia who are interested in acupuncture treatment.

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common optic nerve disorder in patients over age 50 years [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35943/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Ischemic optic neuropathy is generally categorized as anterior (affecting the optic disc) versus posterior (retrobulbar) and as arteritic versus nonarteritic. Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) is less common than anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    PION is believed to result from an infarction of the retrobulbar optic nerve and is distinguished clinically from AION by a normal-appearing optic nerve head. As such, the diagnosis of PION can be somewhat more challenging than AION; PION must be distinguished from other causes of retrobulbar optic neuropathy as well as other causes of abrupt vision loss.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic discusses PION. Other forms of ischemic optic neuropathy and other optic neuropathies are discussed separately. (See",

"     VASCULAR ANATOMY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The vascular supply of the retrobulbar optic nerve is distinct from that of the optic nerve head. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?19/61/20442?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H2#H2\">",
"     \"Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies\", section on 'Vascular anatomy'",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The posterior segment of the optic nerve is usually supplied by a pial capillary plexus that surrounds the nerve and is derived from collateral branches of the ophthalmic artery (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53007 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/9/41110\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35943/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Most of the vascular supply is superficial; only a small number of capillaries penetrate the nerve and extend to its central portion, making this area somewhat poorly vascularized in comparison to its anterior portion. Because it is encased in the sphenoid optic canal, the early swelling that occurs after ischemic insult can lead to axonal compression further exacerbating optic nerve damage [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35943/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The histopathology of PION occurring in the perioperative setting has been reported in at least four cases that showed intraorbital optic nerve infarction extending from retrobulbar to intracanalicular portions bilaterally [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35943/abstract/5-9\">",
"     5-9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Consistent with its vascular supply, predominant involvement of the central axial portion of the retrobulbar nerve, with relatively sparing of the periphery was observed in three of these cases [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35943/abstract/6,10\">",
"     6,10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Relative sparing of the central portion of the nerve in one case suggests that there may be some variability in the vascular supply; some individuals may have an axial supply stemming in retrograde fashion from the central retinal artery [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35943/abstract/2,5\">",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;PION is relatively uncommon compared with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In one clinician's experience over 30 years, more than 1300 patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy had been referred, compared with 42 patients referred with PION [",

"      The mean patient age was 62 years in one series (range 18 to 90 years). The mean age varies by etiologic category; patients with giant cell arteritis are older (mean 78 years, range 50 to 82 years), while those with PION in the setting of spine surgery are younger on average.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      There is a higher than expected prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors and comorbid vascular disease, especially in patients with nonarteritic (idiopathic) PION, with 87 percent of patients having at least one risk factor for, or one other manifestation of, atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

"     <li>",
"      Gender does not appear to be a risk factor for PION.",

Temporal artery biopsy should be considered if ESR or CRP are abnormal or if there is an otherwise high clinical suspicion for GCA because of suggestive symptoms such as headache or jaw claudication.

"     SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;PION is believed to result from an infarction of the retrobulbar optic nerve. While there is much overlap, the vascular anatomy, etiologies, and clinical presentation of PION are distinct from those of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which is more common and affects the optic nerve head.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      There are three distinct etiologic categories that account for the majority of patients with PION: perioperative, arteritic, and nonarteritic (idiopathic) PION. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Etiologies and pathogenesis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Perioperative PION is most often described in the setting of spinal surgeries and radical neck dissection, although a wide range of operative procedures have been implicated. Hypotension and blood loss are the most universal risk factors for this complication. Localized venous hypertension resulting from prolonged use of the prone position in spine surgery and from internal jugular venous ligation in neck dissections are believed to contribute to PION in these cases. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Perioperative PION'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      PION is an infrequent complication of giant cell arteritis, a condition occurring exclusively in older adults (&gt;50 years) and associated with a prodrome of polymyalgia rheumatica. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"       'Arteritic PION'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      More than half of PION cases are classified as nonarteritic, idiopathic. Associated comorbidities in these patients suggest that nonarteritic PION is a manifestation of systemic vascular disease. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H7\">",
"       'Nonarteritic (idiopathic) PION'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Most patients with PION present with abrupt, painless, monocular vision loss. About half of patients with perioperative PION will have bilateral vision loss, while patients with arteritic PION are at risk for rapidly sequential vision loss affecting first one eye then the next. Vision loss is usually severe in patients with perioperative and arteritic PION, but is more variable in patients with nonarteritic PION. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"       'Clinical presentation'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      PION is a diagnosis of exclusion. The most urgent diagnostic imperative is to diagnose or exclude GCA with ESR and CRP",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       and/or",
"      </span>",
"      a temporal artery biopsy. Patients also require ophthalmologic examination and a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging study that focuses on the optic nerves. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Patients with PION and GCA are treated with corticosteroids. While significant visual recovery is unlikely, treatment is aimed at preventing vision loss in the other eye. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H12\">",
"       'Prognosis and treatment'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Patients with perioperative PION do not usually experience significant visual recovery, while up to one-third of patients with nonarteritic (idiopathic) PION may improve. There is no treatment for perioperative or nonarteritic PION. Patients with nonarteritic PION may experience a subsequent episode in the other eye over the next months and years, but interventions (such as atherosclerosis risk factor management and",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Learning disabilities (LD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the unexpected failure of an individual to acquire, retrieve, and use information competently. They are the most severe, pervasive, and chronic form of learning difficulty in children with average or above-average intellectual abilities [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    LD have a multifactorial etiology [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. They typically manifest as a failure to acquire reading, writing, or math skills at grade- and age-expected levels. Learning problems that are outside of these traditional core domains, such as memory problems, attention problems, and difficulty managing social interactions, are not typically considered to be LD. However, they may affect reading, writing, and math and may be a separate focus for intervention.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The evaluation of children with LD will be presented here. The clinical features, management, and prognosis of LD and the role of the primary care provider are discussed separately. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In this topic review, the term \"learning disability\" (or \"specific learning disability\") refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the unexpected failure of an individual to acquire, retrieve, and use information competently.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    However, in some countries, the term \"learning disability\" is used to refer to intellectual disability (formerly \"mental retardation\"). Intellectual disability is discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?26/10/26793?source=see_link\">",

"     DEFINITION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The core feature of a specific learning disability (LD) is an intrinsic cognitive difficulty that results in academic achievement at a level less than expected for the individual's intellectual potential [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/4,5\">",
"     4,5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Several definitions of learning disability agree with this core concept (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53010 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?30/34/31276\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/6-8\">",
"     6-8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Despite conceptual agreement, the current definitions of LD are not specific enough for consistent case definition. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/38/37480?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H3#H3\">",

"     OVERVIEW",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Early identification of learning disabilities (LD) is crucial to providing interventions to optimize learning and prevent secondary emotional problems [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/4,9\">",
"     4,9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Because early recognition may affect ultimate outcome, pediatric healthcare providers should have a low threshold for considering LD in children who are at risk and those who have problems at school (whether the problems are in academic achievement, behavior, attention, or social interaction). (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?31/57/32665?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H6#H6\">",
"     \"Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features\", section on 'Risk factors'",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    LD usually are identified when the child fails to achieve academic milestones alongside",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     his/her",
"    </span>",
"    peers. Any child who is failing at school who has had adequate educational exposure should be presumed to have a learning disability until proven otherwise. Qualitative observations",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    the child's report card often are sufficient to identify learning failure, but psychometric testing is used to make a formal diagnosis. (See",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H19\">",
"     'Comprehensive evaluation'",
"    </a>",
"    below.)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The formal definitions of LD (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53010 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?30/34/31276\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    ) do not specify which psychometric tests to use to identify an LD, what cut-off scores to use on the psychometric tests, or how qualitative observations of the child's performance are to be used in making a diagnosis of LD. These components of the identification of LD are thus left to the individual tester. As a result, there is significant variability in the diagnosis of LD in research studies, school districts, and states of the United States [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This affects which students are included in research studies and which are identified by schools as being in need of services [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?35/6/35944/abstract/11-14\">",
"     11-14",

The discrepancy formula relies on the use of a measure of intelligence (eg, an intelligence quotient [IQ] test) to measure the student's \"ability\", which is then compared with the student's \"achievement\" in a particular academic area. For example, a student may have an IQ score of 100 but have a score of 80 in a specific academic domain. This (statistically significant) discrepancy indicates the presence of an LD in that academic domain, because the student's IQ (ability) would predict a score of 100.",

"      The core feature of a specific learning disability (LD) is an intrinsic cognitive difficulty that results in academic achievement at a level less than expected for the individual's intellectual potential. (See",

"       'Definition'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Early identification of LD is crucial to providing interventions to optimize learning and prevent secondary emotional problems. Any child who is failing at school should be presumed to have a learning disability until proven otherwise. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",

"     <li>",
"      The diagnosis of LD is made primarily by history. Psychometric measures help to confirm the presence of LD and identify targets for intervention. An appropriate assessment for LD includes information from standardized psychometric measures, a review of the student's educational history, and a description of classroom observations. These three components are required for accurate identification and description of the LD, and are also required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In addition, schools can use data collected from response to intervention (RTI) services or by following the student&rsquo;s progress over time. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H21\">",

School districts vary in how they define the &ldquo;adverse impact&rdquo; of the student&rsquo;s disability on the student&rsquo;s education.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well-established procedure for answering important clinical questions, such as diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease, as well as assessment of exercise capacity or tolerance. The exercise ECG indirectly detects myocardial ischemia, which is the physiologic consequence of a mismatch between the supply and demand for blood.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Testing is often performed in the primary care physician's or cardiovascular specialist's office, but may also be carried out in other settings such as hospitals, research centers, or cardiac rehabilitation programs.",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The clinical manifestations of brain tumors are determined by the anatomic location of the lesion and its rate of growth, as well as the histology of the specific tumor. Although symptoms, imaging characteristics, and demographic features may suggest a specific tumor type, definitive diagnosis of a brain tumor requires biopsy confirmation. (See",

"    For the rare brain tumors that are reviewed here, information about the clinical and imaging manifestations, natural history, and management is based upon case reports and small series. Recommendations regarding treatment are extrapolated from these limited data and from general principles of brain tumor management.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas comprise a spectrum of low-grade tumors characterized by a neoplastic neuronal population. In gangliogliomas, the neoplastic neuronal cells are accompanied by neoplastic glial cells, while in gangliocytomas, large, well-differentiated neurons are the sole neoplastic component. Although these tumors may arise anywhere in the neuraxis, most are supratentorial and located in the temporal lobes.",
"   </p>",

"    The initial management is surgical resection. Totally resected tumors seldom recur, and the prognosis is good even after subtotal resection. This was illustrated by a series of 25 patients, in which the four-year progression-free survival was 78 percent after gross total resection and 63 percent after subtotal resection [",

The lesion arises in the cerebellar hemispheres, most commonly on the left, with rare extension into the vermis.",

The mass is well circumscribed and distinct from the surrounding tissue. In rare cases it enhances with contrast, which may represent venous proliferation in the outer portions of the cerebellar cortex and prominent draining veins. The blood brain barrier is intact [",

"    HRCT shows scarring with bibasilar loss of volume in the posterobasal and laterobasal segments of both lower lobes. The segmental bronchi are mildly distended and distorted (arrows). They are wider in diameter than their accompanying segmental pulmonary artery branches and are close together. These changes are probably due to a previous, incompletely resolved pneumonia.",
