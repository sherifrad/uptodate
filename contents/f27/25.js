"    Examples of nasal potential difference tracings in a normal patient (Panel A) and a patient with cystic fibrosis (Panel B). The x-axis is time (min) as described, and the y-axis is nasal potential difference (PD) (mV, upward is polarizing). The normal phenotype includes a lower (less polarized) baseline PD in Solution #1, a small depolarizing change in PD after amiloride perfusion (Solution #2), and a repolarizing PD after perfusion with low-chloride (0 [CI-]) and low-chloride + isoproterenol (Solutions #3 and #4 - continued presence of amiloride). The cystic fibrosis phenotype includes a higher (more polarized) baseline PD, a large depolarizing change in PD after amiloride perfusion, and absent repolarization after perfusion with 0 [CI-] and 0 [CI-] + isoproterenol. ATP-stimulated PD (Solution #5, reflecting stimulation of calcium activated chloride conductance) is retained in normal subjects and in subjects with cystic fibrosis.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Uterine activity (frequency, duration, and strength of contractions) is monitored intrapartum because it is an important factor in the assessment of labor progress and in the interpretation of the fetal heart rate pattern. Uterine activity can be monitored during labor by external palpation, external tocodynamometry, or internal tocodynamometry utilizing an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) (",

"    ]. External palpation is subjective and requires that a clinician be present to physically monitor the contractions. External tocodynamometry provides an objective record of the frequency and duration of contractions, without requiring the physical presence of a clinician, but the tracing can be interrupted by maternal movement, and contraction strength is not assessed. By comparison, the IUPC provides a reliable, quantifiable measure of contraction frequency, duration, and strength, without requiring the attendance of a clinician and without interference by maternal movement [",

A single randomized trial of 249 patients demonstrated that the transducer tip catheter had a higher extramembranous (between the membranes and decidua) placement rate than the sensor-tipped catheter (12.5 versus 2.4 percent, P = 0.02), but there was no difference in the frequency of abruption or fetal distress [",

At our institution, we use the Koala&reg; IPC 5000; therefore, we will mostly focus on the instructions for insertion of the sensor-tipped device.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The provider performs a cervical examination to confirm adequate cervical dilation, ruptured membranes, and presenting part, and to determine optimal position for catheter placement. Placement laterally and away from the placenta is easiest and least likely to cause complications. We do not use ultrasound to guide placement. The symphysis and sacrum can increase resistance if anterior or posterior insertions are attempted.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The provider inserts the tip of the introducer (with the catheter inside) just inside the cervical os, avoiding placement between the decidua and membranes. The introducer is then held steady while the catheter is gently threaded 10 to 14 cm into the amniotic cavity until the bottom of the introducer is at the first mark on the catheter imprinted by the manufacturer. In this position, the tip is usually just beyond the fetal head. The catheter should go in easily and never be forced. If any resistance is met, the operator should change the angle or position of insertion of the catheter. It is possible to force a catheter completely through the placenta, myometrium, or velamentous umbilical cord [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28053/abstract/13\">",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Flow of amniotic fluid through the catheter at this point indicates appropriate placement. Absence of amniotic fluid may indicate incorrect extramembranous placement, but is not a reliable sign of extramembranous placement for transducer-tipped catheters. Extramembranous catheters will provide readings, but they are not accurate reflections of intrauterine pressure and cannot be used for amnioinfusion. If the catheter is in a dry pocket, it can be withdrawn to the fingertips and then redirected and reinserted. If the absence of fluid is thought to be related to oligohydramnios, 10 to 20 mL of sterile saline or water can be flushed through the port.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    If frank blood (as opposed to blood tinged amniotic fluid) is observed in the catheter, it may indicate extramembranous placement, placement in the placenta or umbilical cord, placental abruption, or uterine perforation. Immediate fetal and maternal assessment is warranted; removal of the IUPC depends on the clinical situation. The Koala&reg; IPC 5000 package insert states the catheter should be removed immediately and the maternal and fetal clinical status should be assessed before a new catheter is inserted in a different area.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Once proper placement in the amniotic cavity is established, the catheter is advanced further (about 45 cm), to the second mark imprinted on the catheter by the manufacturer, and then the introducer is removed. The IUPC is secured to the patient&rsquo;s upper medial thigh. The catheter is connected to the monitor cable and the monitor is zeroed (for sensor-tipped IUPCs, the monitor should be at zero before the electronic sensor tip is connected and when a manometer based transducer tip is open to the air). Baseline tone at term is between 5 and 15 mmHg, but may be higher preterm. Proper placement and function are confirmed by having the patient cough, which should produce a sharp spike in pressure. Transducer-tipped catheters may be zeroed prior to or after insertion of the catheter, and typically have a baseline pressure reading of 5 to 25 mmHg at term.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has rapidly become an important tool in the investigation of patients with hepatobiliary disease, particularly for the characterization and staging of liver lesions seen on other imaging tests. MRI also has a role as a noninvasive means of imaging the biliary tree. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/51/23351?source=see_link\">",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     TECHNIQUE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;MRI uses a strong magnetic field to align rotating hydrogen protons within the tissue being imaged. During realignment of the protons, energy is released and sampled at different time intervals. The measured signal intensity from this energy depends upon the degree and rate of realignment within a very specific time period, which in turn depends upon the water and fat content of the different tissues. These signals are then converted into gray scale cross-sectional images that can be depicted in multiple planes or in three dimensions [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28054/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The T1 and T2 relaxation times are important parameters determining image and lesion contrast with reference to normal liver parenchyma.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The T1 relaxation time (and the resulting T1-weighted image) refers to the time required for protons to fully realign within an external magnetic field following exposure to a radio wave pulse of specific strength and duration",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The T2 relaxation time (and the resulting T2-weighted image) describes the rate at which protons are put out of phase with respect to adjacent protons",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These two measurements affect the signal intensities of tissues being imaged and are therefore crucial for creation of the final images. As an example, water has low signal intensity (dark) on T1-weighted images but high intensity (bright) on T2-weighted images, with the reverse being true for fat. Each tissue in the body has characteristic T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities. In particular, abnormal tissue such as tumor will differ from adjacent normal tissue because of a variety of factors including tissue water content, different contrast enhancement properties, and vascularity [",

"     T1 sequences",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Breath-hold spoiled gradient echo (SGE) is a T1-weighted sequence in which the entire liver can be imaged during a single suspended respiration in &lt;6 seconds. The advantages of this technique also include strong T1 weighting and a good signal-to-noise ratio. In&ndash;phase and out-of-phase T1-weighted SGE sequences are used to detect fatty liver. Three-dimensional gradient echo (GRE) imaging is a T1-weighted modality that provides good segmental and vascular anatomy for surgical planning.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A non-contrast T1&ndash;weighted sequence is of foremost importance in lesion detection and characterization. Hemorrhagic lesions, those with high",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     protein/fat",
"    </span>",
"    content, and those with melanin are high in signal on T1 sequences. Lesions with a high fluid content (such as simple cyst and hemangioma) are very low in signal. Hypovascular and fibrotic lesions (such as colon cancer metastases) are moderately low in signal.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The most commonly used T2-weighted sequence is breathing averaged, conventional or echo train spin, combined with fat suppression. Fat suppression improves visualization of regions bordered by fat, as in the subcapsular parenchyma, in addition to decreasing the motion artifact from subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. Breathing independent sequences are used in patients who are incapable of breathing regularly. The main value of these images is in distinguishing cysts and hemangiomas (which have high fluid content) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastases (which have low fluid content). Heavily T2-weighted sequences are sensitive for exposing the super paramagnetic effects of intracellular ferritin and hemosiderin. Thus, they can be useful for diagnosing hemochromatosis (see",

MRI is of value in defining the relationship of tumor to blood vessels and in distinguishing small HCC from small hemangiomas. The degree of enhancement of the lesion with mangafodipir trisodium correlates with the histologic differentiation, thereby providing a noninvasive index of tumor biology. The fibrolamellar variant is homogenous and hypointense on T1 sequences, and heterogeneous and hyperintense on T2 sequences. The central scar is hypointense on both T1 and T2 images as a result of its fibrous composition.

"     . Risk may be more than 100-fold greater than in untreated population. Current estimates of aplastic anemia-related fatality are 20% to 30%, but higher rates (up to 70%) have been reported in the past. It is not known if dose, duration, or use of concomitant medications affects risk. Aplastic anemia can develop at any point during therapy. Routine blood monitoring is recommended to potentially allow for detection of hematologic changes, although aplastic anemia can occur without warning.",

The overall postmarketing reported rate of hepatic failure leading to transplant or death is 6 cases per 75,000 patient years of use; this rate is underestimated due to under reporting (eg, the true rate could be as high as 1 case per 1250 patient years of use if the reporting rate is only 10%). Approximately 67% of the reported cases of hepatic failure led to liver transplantation or death, usually within 5 weeks of the onset of signs and symptoms of hepatic failure; the earliest onset of severe liver dysfunction was 3 weeks after starting felbamate; in some cases, dark urine and nonspecific prodromal symptoms (eg, malaise, anorexia, GI symptoms) preceded the onset of jaundice. It is not known if dose, duration, or use of concomitant medications affects risk of hepatic failure. Felbamate should not be used in any patient with a history of hepatic dysfunction.",

"     All patients receiving felbamate must be monitored closely; in addition, a CBC with differential and platelet count should be taken before, during, and for a significant time after discontinuing felbamate therapy; liver enzyme tests and bilirubin should be obtained before initiation and periodically during therapy. Felbamate should be immediately withdrawn if abnormal liver function tests or bone marrow suppression occur. Do not restart felbamate in patients who experience hematologic or hepatic adverse reactions.",

"     Felbamate should only be used in patients who have severe, refractory seizures that are unresponsive to other medications. The FDA and the manufacturer strongly recommend that physicians discuss the risks of felbamate with each patient and a written informed consent be obtained from the patient prior to starting therapy or before continuing therapy. A patient information consent form is included as part of the package insert and is available from the local Wallace representative or by calling 800-526-3840.",

"     Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation in patients receiving these medications for any indication. Pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials involving 11 different AEDs (regardless of indication) showed a twofold increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior (estimated incidence rate: 0.43% in AED treated patients compared to 0.24% of patients receiving placebo); increased risk was observed as early as 1 week after initiation of AED and continued through duration of trials (most trials &le;24 weeks); risk did not vary significantly by age (age range: 5-100 years). Consider risks and benefits of AEDs before prescribing. Monitor all patients receiving an AED for emergence of suicidal thoughts or behavior, thoughts of self-harm, any unusual changes in behavior or mood, or the emergence or worsening of depressive symptoms; notify healthcare provider immediately if symptoms or concerning behavior occur.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thyroid nodules come to clinical attention when noted by the patient, or as an incidental finding during routine physical examination or a radiologic procedure, such as carotid ultrasonography or neck computed tomography (CT). Their clinical importance is primarily related to the need to exclude thyroid cancer, which is present in 4 to 6.5 percent of thyroid nodules. If a serum TSH is normal, the next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a palpation or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.",
"   </p>",

"    ], by repetitively moving a 23- to 27-gauge (most commonly 25- or 27-gauge) needle through the nodule. The needle is attached to a 10 mL syringe that may be contained in a holder designed to facilitate the application of constant or intermittent suction. The aspirated material is smeared directly on slides, fixed, and stained, or collected in a liquid preservative from which thin-layer preparations are made. (See",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"     'Procedure'",
"    </a>",
"    below.)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    With experience, adequate samples can be obtained in 90 to 97 percent of aspirations of solid nodules [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28056/abstract/2-6\">",
"     2-6",
"    </a>",

"     Fine-needle capillary sampling",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Fine-needle capillary sampling (FNC, also called fine-needle nonaspiration biopsy) is a variation of FNA in which the sample is obtained by repetitively moving within the nodule a 25- to 27-gauge needle that is not attached to a syringe [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28056/abstract/8,9\">",
"     8,9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. After the needle is removed from the nodule, a syringe containing air is used to express the sample on a slide, which is smeared, stained, and submitted for cytologic interpretation. An FNA done with the syringe attached to the needle but with no negative aspiration pressure provides similar results.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     FNA versus FNC",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The negative aspiration pressure used for FNA may result in more tissue damage and bleeding than FNC. This is a potential problem since blood and fibrin can obscure cells and therefore limit the ability to interpret the specimen.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The relative efficacy of these procedures was evaluated in a study of 104 thyroid aspirates [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28056/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The specimens obtained by FNA were significantly more likely to be nondiagnostic than those obtained by FNC (16 versus 6 percent). In a second report, the percentage of nondiagnostic samples at a variety of body sites was the same with both techniques, but the cytologic smears obtained with FNC were of higher quality [",

"      ]. It is almost never the initial procedure of choice because of a higher risk of bleeding and increased patient discomfort. Unlike FNA, which samples many areas of a nodule, a cutting needle provides only a single core. However, histopathology may provide better information about thyroid architecture, and this procedure may be useful for suspected lymphoma.",
"      <br/>",
"      <br/>",
"      The major utility of core-needle biopsy is after one or more non-diagnostic FNAs. In one study of patients who had one non-diagnostic FNA, a core-needle biopsy provided diagnostic results in 74 percent of patients while a repeat FNA provided a result in only 52 percent of patients [",

The author of this topic typically does four passes with a 25- or 27-gauge needle, some with, and some without suction. In a small minority of patients, if the sample is scant, the author uses a 21-gauge needle during FNA. A 1 or 1&frac12; needle is typically used. The role and value of ultrasound guidance is discussed separately. (See",

"     PROCEDURE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;FNA is a simple outpatient office procedure that requires no advanced preparation; many patients undergo FNA at their initial visit with an endocrinologist. It is usually performed on a standard examination table in the supine position with a pillow placed under the patient's shoulders to allow for increased neck extension. We usually administer a local anesthetic. For children and adults unable to cooperate with the procedure, conscious sedation may be used.",

However, these drugs should not be discontinued if it places the patient at high risk of a complication, and we generally do not reschedule the procedure if the patient did not discontinue these drugs. Anticoagulant agents such as",

"    are also preferably discontinued four to five days before FNA. However, small nodules that can readily be compressed against the trachea to achieve hemostasis can be safely aspirated despite anticoagulation, using a 27-gauge needle and a minimum number of passes. Some clinicians feel that the procedure is safer when the INR is &lt;2.0.",

"    Aggressive lymphomas are readily diagnosed based upon clinical findings and lymphocytes on FNA or core needle biopsy. However, low-grade lymphomas may be difficult to distinguish from Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Virtually all thyroid lymphomas originate within Hashimoto's thyroiditis; as a result, sampling error is also a concern. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemical studies may be useful, and may require larger fragments of tissue from a cutting needle biopsy. The patient may be spared surgery if the diagnosis can be made on needle biopsy, although many pathologists prefer tissue obtained from an open biopsy. (See",

"      The clinical importance of thyroid nodules is primarily related to the need to exclude thyroid cancer, which is present in 4 to 6.5 percent of thyroid nodules. If a serum TSH is normal, the next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is a palpation or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Dementia is a disorder that is characterized by impairment of memory and at least one other cognitive domain (aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, executive function). These must represent a decline from previous level of function and be severe enough to interfere with daily function and independence [",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28057/abstract/6\">",
"     6",

"      Patients with depression are more likely to complain about memory loss than those with dementia; the latter are frequently brought to physicians by their families, while depressed patients often present by themselves.

"    The pretest probability of dementia and of various causes of dementia depends upon patient characteristics such as age and race.

"     <li>",
"      The initial step in the evaluation of a patient with suspected dementia should focus upon the history. Family members or other informants who know the patient well are invaluable resources for providing an adequate history of cognitive and behavioral changes.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Adequate time should be arranged for a full assessment of cognitive function, followed by a complete physical examination, including neurologic examination.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The Mini-Mental State Exam is a useful screening test for dementia; a score of less than 24 points is suggestive of dementia or delirium.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Neuropsychologic testing batteries may be useful in identifying patients with dementia, particularly when administered to those who may be at increased risk of cognitive impairment.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Screening for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism is recommended for patients being evaluated for dementia.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Screening for depression in patients with dementia is recommended because depression is a common treatable comorbidity that may also masquerade as dementia.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Genetic testing for the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4allele is not currently recommended, nor is genetic testing for other potential causes of dementia.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Structural neuroimaging with either a noncontrast head CT or MRI should be considered in the initial evaluation of all patients with dementia.",

"    Pediatric palliative care will be reviewed here. The many aspects of palliative care in adults are discussed separately. (See",

"     GOALS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The overall goal of pediatric palliative care is to enhance the quality of life for a child with an underlying life-threatening illness. As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO), pediatric palliative care \"is the active total care of the child's body, mind, and spirit, and also involves giving support to the family. It begins when illness is diagnosed, and continues regardless of whether or not a child receives treatment directed at the disease\" [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Timing",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;As noted by the WHO statement, families of children with a diagnosis where cure may not be possible are ideally introduced to palliative care at the time of diagnosis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/5,6\">",
"     5,6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Palliative care is introduced from the beginning of the treatment by acknowledging that it helps to ensure an ongoing focus on quality of life with relief of symptoms so that the child's enjoyment of life can continue [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/7-11\">",
"     7-11",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Children with chronic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or severe neurological impairment, may benefit from the introduction of palliative care if symptom management is difficult or if there is significant suffering. This often becomes evident at a time of decline in health status, which results in uncertainty regarding outcome, and impacts quality of life [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Overly optimistic estimates of prognosis are a common barrier to initiation of palliative care [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/13,14\">",
"     13,14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, the introduction of palliative care does not mean that curative treatments, which seek to reverse the disease process, or disease modifying treatments when cure is not possible, need to be terminated if they remain appropriate [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Although medical teams often worry that families \"are not ready\" to address these issues, evidence show that integration of palliative care does not lessen parents' hope [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, prognostic information that clinicians considered upsetting does not lessen a parent's desire for this information, and is often considered important to decision making [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Palliative care recognizes that there is always care to provide, such as attention to physical symptoms or emotional distress, regardless of the clinical situation [",

"     6,15,16",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/25/28058/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Parents and families who are poorly prepared in addressing quality of life tend to choose more intensive and invasive interventions that may prolong suffering near the end of life [",

"     <li>",
"      Decision-making about ongoing medical treatment based upon the goals for the total care of the child and family rather than treating a clinical problem in isolation. This can help to avoid the pitfall of performing an intervention out of a sense of needing to do something when parents and physicians become distressed over the limits of medicine. The care plan needs to adapt to alterations in the needs of the patient and family as the disease progresses.",

"   <p>",
"    Discussing resuscitative and life-sustaining efforts requires an honest assessment of the likelihood of benefit and possible harm, and is based upon the steps discussed above. It is important that the care team assume responsibility for this process so as to not imply undue parental responsibility for any decision regarding life-sustaining measures. This is ideally a process of shared decision-making. As an example, avoid asking parents if they wish their child to be resuscitated; this focused question implies offering something that would benefit the child and shifts the decision-making burden to the parents. It is also important to reassure patients and families that a decision to forgo life-sustaining measures will not alter ongoing care of a patient.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This is also a time to remind families that when there is a decline in health, it is not a result of any decisions made to limit interventions or of the care provided at home, but rather a result of the health problems that cannot be \"cured\" or \"fixed\". The family should be reassured that interventions will continue as long as they maintain sufficient benefit to quality of life.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;One of the most difficult aspects of the management of terminally ill patients is the decision of whether to initiate artificial nutrition or hydration (ANH) when patients are unable to take adequate oral nutrition or fluids. It remains uncertain whether ANH provides sufficient benefit to justify the risks of its known complications (eg, vomiting, oral and airway secretions, and edema). The symbolic significance of nutrition and the myths about dehydration and \"starvation\" can lead to initiation of ANH without an adequate assessment of its complications and potential lack of benefit [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Both well-hydrated and dehydrated terminal patients experience thirst, presumably because oral factors are as important as the level of systemic hydration. Thirst can be controlled with small amounts of oral fluids and oral hygiene. Mouth dryness can be relieved with moistened swabs, ice chips, or petroleum jelly on the lips. Thus, it is rarely necessary to begin artificial hydration in terminally ill patients because of thirst. The pros and cons of administering artificial hydration in the terminally ill cancer patient are discussed separately. (See",
