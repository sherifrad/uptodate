"<dd id='Section0'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Total body water is depleted, without equivalent reduction in solutes. Patients with pure dehydration usually have relatively fewer signs of intravascular depletion and relatively more signs of intracellular fluid losses (e.g., decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes).",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Dehydration is nearly always accompanied by some degree of volume depletion, and test abnormalities overlap significantly with those of volume depletion. Despite significant overlap, the distinction is important in directing therapies and monitoring for complications.In isolated dehydration, serum sodium is high.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Hypertension is usually present.Clinical indicators of fluid retention are present despite decreased urine output.Cola-coloured urine is classically described in acute glomerulonephritis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Urine sediment has blood, casts, proteinuria, and other abnormalities.Urea and serum creatinine both elevated.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Onset of symptoms is generally extremely gradual.Deficiencies of &ge;1 of the 3 groups of adrenal steroid hormones can co-exist and in many cases are similar to findings of volume depletion (i.e., fatigue, vomiting, hypotension).In cases of adrenal androgen deficiency, hyperpigmentation may be notable on mucous membranes, extensor surfaces, and palms.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, normal anion gap, and metabolic acidosis are classically seen.ECG may show signs of hyperkalaemia.Serum cortisol may be low, but cortisol is always inappropriately low under conditions of stress.</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Significant abdominal tenderness, bilious emesis, passage of mucus, bloody stool (jelly-like stool), are classically described.A sausage-shaped mass may be palpable and is highly suggestive of intussusceptions.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain abdominal x-ray or abdominal CT scan may show obstructive pattern with dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels.</p>",
