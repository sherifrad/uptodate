"      People with Down syndrome have a problem with their chromosomes. Chromosomes are tiny parts of cells that carry the plans that make our bodies the way they are.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Schistosomiasis is caused by infection with Schistosoma haematobium, S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, or S. intercalatum. The glomerular disease associated with schistosomiasis will be discussed here. Other issues related to schistosomiasis are presented separately. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Chronic infection with Schistosoma mansoni (and, to a lesser degree, other schistosomal species) is associated with glomerular disease in 10 to 15 percent of patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34243/abstract/1-7\">",
"     1-7",

"      Antibodies against schistosomal antigens can often be eluted from the glomeruli.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Schistosomal antigens have been detected in the glomeruli by indirect immunofluorescence (in which fluoresceinated anti-schistosomal antibodies are incubated with the renal tissue).",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although direct deposition of schistosomal antigens is responsible for the initial glomerular injury, hepatic fibrosis induced by chronic hepatosplenic infection plays an important role in the subsequent disease progression [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34243/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Circulating schistosomal immune complexes are normally removed by the Kupffer cells in the liver; in the presence of portal hypertension, however, the circulation is partially bypassed, resulting in increased delivery to and deposition in the glomeruli.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The observation that patients with overt renal disease have a predominance of IgA deposition in the glomeruli is also compatible with a \"liver effect\" since glomerular IgA deposition is also seen in cirrhosis due to impaired clearance of IgA-containing immune complexes [",

"    A confounding factor is that many patients with liver and renal involvement are coinfected with hepatitis C virus, particularly in endemic areas [",

"     7",

"      Class II is an exudative glomerulonephritis, with neutrophils and monocytes as well as deposition of IgG and complement. This lesion is commonly observed with dual infection with schistosoma and salmonella species. Affected patients usually present with an acute febrile illness, as well as signs and symptoms of salmonella infection. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is an uncommon illness with an annual incidence of 1 to 2 per 100,000 individuals in the United States [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The peak onset is between the ages of 30 and 50. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?28/34/29224?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    As of 1971, only 12 cases of pregnancy in women with SSc had been reported. Mortality among these patients was alarmingly high: four patients died (three from renal and pulmonary disease and one from a postpartum viral infection) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The incidence of pregnancy in women with SSc is increasing since a greater number of women are choosing to have children later in life.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic will review issues of fertility and pregnancy outcome among patients with SSc, as well as the impact of pregnancy upon disease activity.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     FERTILITY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;It is difficult to draw any clear conclusions concerning fertility in women with SSc. In the 1950s, women with SSc were thought to have diminished fertility because of the low incidence of pregnancy in those with preexisting disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, subsequent studies showed mixed results with respect to pregnancy rates and to the frequency of pregnancy difficulties among women with SSc, both prior to and after the diagnosis.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The following findings were noted in different observational studies of women with SSc who were of child-bearing age:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      A nonsignificant threefold increase in risk of the combined end-point of infertility and spontaneous abortion compared with controls in a retrospective analysis of events prior to the diagnosis of SSc [",

"       5",
"      </a>",
"      ]",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      A higher incidence of infertility and a longer time to conceive prior to the diagnosis of SSC compared with healthy controls (odds ratio 2.3 and 2.6, respectively) but not compared with women with primary Raynaud phenomenon [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/6\">",
"       6",
"      </a>",
"      ]",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Significantly more live births prior to the onset of SSc and significantly fewer live births after the onset of SSC compared with women in the general population [",

"       8",
"      </a>",
"      ]",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are limited by their reliance upon patient recall and by a failure to usually distinguish whether women had difficulty conceiving or did not desire pregnancy.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     SPONTANEOUS ABORTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Compared with the information available concerning SSc and fertility, somewhat more conclusive data have been published relating to the rate of spontaneous abortion in women who become pregnant prior to an eventual diagnosis of SSc. Multiple studies (but not all) suggest that such women have an increased risk [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/5,9,10\">",
"     5,9,10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. As an example, the rate of spontaneous miscarriage among pregnant women, both prior to and subsequent to a diagnosis of SSc, was assessed in one study of 14 patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The rate of spontaneous miscarriage was significantly higher among those who became pregnant prior to disease diagnosis when compared with control individuals (22 versus 14 percent). Pregnant patients with preexisting SSc also had a significantly increased rate of spontaneous abortions. A similar risk (relative risk 2.1) was noted in another report of nearly 270 women with SSc [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In contrast to these findings, a third study found an increased number of elective (but not spontaneous) abortions among patients who became pregnant after disease onset, compared with controls [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Thus, miscarriage appears to be more common among those who eventually develop SSc, but it remains unclear whether spontaneous abortions occur more frequently among those already diagnosed with the disorder. Data concerning the abortion rate among patients with a preexisting diagnosis of SSc are also clouded by the paucity of information regarding medication use during pregnancy [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Whether a history of a spontaneous abortion may predispose a woman to subsequently develop SSc is unknown [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PREGNANCY OUTCOME",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The effect of SSc upon pregnancy outcome is unknown. One study compared outcomes in women with SSc with those in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in control individuals [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A nonsignificant trend toward an increased rate of premature births among patients with SSc, compared with the other two groups, was observed. In addition, there was an increased incidence of infants small for gestational age born to women with SSc, but there was no statistically significant increase in fetal death [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/10,12\">",
"     10,12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. An expanded study by the same group of investigators retrospectively obtained reproductive histories in 214 women with SSc and compared them with 167 women with rheumatoid arthritis and with 105 neighborhood controls [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The patients with SSc had more premature births and more infants small for gestational age after disease onset; however, the effect of age on these results was not analyzed.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These studies are flawed because the impact of medication use and of other risk factors for prematurity was not assessed. Immunosuppressive agents used in patients with SSc, including",
"    <a class=\"drug drug_general\" href=\"UTD.htm?37/43/38585?source=see_link\">",
"     prednisone",
"    </a>",
"    , may cause premature rupture of the membranes, as well as infants small for gestational age [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?37/59/38842?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Use of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There have been several case reports of SSc involving the cervix and perineum [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/13,14\">",
"     13,14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In this setting, vaginal delivery can be difficult, and elective cesarean delivery may be required.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     IMPACT OF PREGNANCY UPON DISEASE ACTIVITY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Few data are available concerning the impact of pregnancy upon the activity of SSc. Most of the published information is skewed toward case reports of poor outcomes. As an example, one report of two patients with three pregnancies found that two of the pregnancies were complicated by hypertension and that one was complicated by congestive heart failure [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. By comparison, another study found that the frequency of general complications, such as hypertension, was similar in patients with SSc and in those with RA [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Pregnancy also had no adverse effect upon long-term survival.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     SSc renal crisis",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Renal disease is common in patients with SSc [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/16\">",
"     16",

"    ]. (See",

"     \"Scleroderma renal crisis\"",
"    </a>",
"    .) In the pregnant patient, however, it is extremely difficult to distinguish renal dysfunction due to SSc from that resulting from preeclampsia and eclampsia. One review of the literature, for example, found that seven of nine patients initially thought to have preeclampsia actually had renal biopsy findings more consistent with SSc renal disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/17\">",
"     17",

"     \"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis\"",
"    </a>",
"    .) Another possible differential in the postpartum period is hemolytic-uremic syndrome; this disorder",
"    <strong>",
"     cannot",
"    </strong>",
"    be distinguished histologically from SSc kidney. (See",

"     \"Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure) in pregnancy\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Whether pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of renal crisis among patients with preexisting SSc is unclear. One study of women with SSc found no enhanced incidence of renal crisis in pregnant women when compared with those who did not become pregnant [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Some investigators, however, believe that renal crisis is more common among those with early diffuse disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34244/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",

"    ]. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was beneficial in one case report, but ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy because of the risk to the fetus [",

"      It is difficult to draw clear conclusions concerning fertility in women with systemic sclerosis (SSc), due to the very limited data that are available. Studies have shown mixed results with respect to pregnancy rates and to the frequency of pregnancy difficulties among women with SSc, both prior to and after the diagnosis. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Fertility'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Multiple studies (but not all) suggest that women who become pregnant prior to an eventual diagnosis of SSc have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. However, it is unclear whether spontaneous abortions occur more frequently among those already diagnosed with the disorder. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Spontaneous abortion'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The effect of SSc upon pregnancy outcome is unknown. Limited study data have suggested a possible increased risk of premature births and of infants small for gestational age after disease onset; however, the impact of medication use, of age, and of other risk factors for prematurity on these results is not known. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Pregnancy outcome'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      It is unclear whether pregnancy affects disease activity or is associated with an increased incidence of renal crisis among patients with preexisting SSc, as very limited data are available. However, extremely high morbidity has been observed among those who develop renal crisis during pregnancy, and patients with SSc and active renal disease should be counseled regarding the high morbidity and mortality associated with pregnancy. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Fetal abdominal wall defects occur in 1 in 2000 live births [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34247/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The most common abdominal wall defects are gastroschisis and omphalocele; uncommon anomalies include ectopia cordis, limb-body wall complex, cloacal exstrophy, and urachal cyst (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79143 \" href=\"UTD.htm?2/3/2107\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). Widespread use of antenatal ultrasound examination and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening has led to increasing detection of these defects in the second trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, with the increased use of first trimester sonography for the assessment of nuchal translucency in screening for Down syndrome, the diagnosis of these defects is shifting to as early as 11 to 14 weeks of gestation. The early gestational scan should be able to detect all cases of omphalocele, gastroschisis, and body stalk anomaly [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34247/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     EMBRYOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;During the 4th to 5th week of development, the flat embryonic disk folds in four directions",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    planes: cephalic, caudal, and right and left lateral. Each fold converges at the site of the umbilicus, thus obliterating the extraembryonic coelom. The lateral folds form the lateral portions of the abdominal wall and the cephalic and caudal folds make up the epigastrium and hypogastrium [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34247/abstract/3,4\">",
"     3,4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Rapid growth of the intestines and liver also occurs at this time. During the 6th week of development (or eight weeks from the last menstrual period), the abdominal cavity temporarily becomes too small to accommodate all of its contents, resulting in protrusion of the intestines into the residual extraembryonic coelom at the base of the umbilical cord. This temporary herniation is called physiologic midgut herniation (PMH) and is sonographically evident between the 9th to 11th postmenstrual weeks (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54907 \" href=\"UTD.htm?34/20/35141\">",
"     image 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). Reduction of this hernia occurs by the 12th postmenstrual week; beyond the 12th week a midgut herniation is no longer physiological [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34247/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A simple midline omphalocele develops if the extra-embryonic gut fails to return to the abdominal cavity and remains covered by the two-layer amnionic-peritoneal layer into which the umbilicus inserts [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34247/abstract/3,4,6\">",
"     3,4,6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In contrast to fetal bowel, the liver does not have a physiological migration outside of the abdominal cavity during development. Therefore, the liver is never present in physiologic midgut herniation. However, if the lateral folds fail to close, a large abdominal wall defect is created through which the abdominal cavity contents, including the liver, can herniate [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34247/abstract/3,4\">",
"     3,4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The result is a liver-containing omphalocele (see",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"     'Containing liver'",

"     INTRODUCTION",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Management of the airway in pregnancy requires careful consideration of physiologic, mechanical, and situational factors. Airway swelling, decreased gastric motility, and the need to establish airway protection emergently in the setting of fetal distress can all contribute to difficult endotracheal intubation and increase the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Early placement of a labor epidural in patients with a potentially difficult airway is a preventative approach that may avoid the need for airway manipulation in the event of an urgent or emergent cesarean delivery.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Difficult intubation has been reported in 1.3 to 16.3 percent of obstetric intubations [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34248/abstract/1\">",
"     1",

"    Failed intubation is much less common. Two of the largest retrospective studies on the rate of failed intubation in obstetrics reviewed data from 1993-1998 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34248/abstract/3\">",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34248/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Other studies have reported fewer failed intubations (1:750 to 1:1500), possibly because of higher overall rates of general anesthesia at these centers, more senior coverage, immediately available trainee supervision, and more vigilant airway assessment and risk stratification [",

"     Maternal mortality related to anesthesia",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A report from the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health for 2006-2008 noted seven deaths directly attributed to anesthesia; two of these deaths were from failure to ventilate the lungs [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34248/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. There were four deaths from postoperative anesthesia-related complications (opioid toxicity during patient-controlled analgesia, transfusion reaction, cardiac arrest and aspiration during recovery from general anesthesia) and one death from leukoencephalitis after spinal anesthesia. Anesthetic management contributed to the outcome in 18 additional deaths.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In an analysis comparing anesthesia-related deaths in the United States from 1991-2002 versus 1979-1990, maternal case fatality rates for general anesthesia at cesarean delivery fell from 16.8 to 6.5 per million general anesthetics, while maternal mortality case fatality rates for regional anesthesia at cesarean delivery rose from 2.5 to 3.8 per million regional anesthetics [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34248/abstract/9,10\">",
"     9,10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In women who received general anesthesia, about two-thirds of deaths associated were caused by intubation failure or induction problems; for women whose deaths were associated with regional anesthesia, 26 percent were caused by high spinal or epidural block, followed by respiratory failure (19 percent), and drug reaction (19 percent).

"     5",
"    </a>",

ACE inhibitors are teratogenic; patients should be counseled to avoid pregnancy, and these drugs and should be discontinued immediately if a pregnancy is discovered.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;As outcomes following nonrenal solid organ transplantation (SOT) have improved, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become an increasingly prevalent complication in this population [",

"     PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION OF KIDNEY FUNCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;As a general rule, the preoperative evaluation of kidney function in candidates for nonrenal SOT should focus upon establishing the likelihood of being left with adequate kidney function post-transplant and the chance of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients who are likely to have stage 4 or stage 5 CKD after the early post-transplant period",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    those with established primary renal disease that is likely to progress at a rapid pace (thereby requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy shortly after transplant) should be listed for combined organ transplant. It should be noted that, in an era of ever-increasing organ shortage, in which waiting times for kidneys are lengthening, combined nonrenal and renal organ transplantation should be considered judiciously.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The vast majority of patients with normal or mild impairment in kidney function should receive a nonrenal SOT alone. However, normal or near normal serum creatinine levels do not necessarily reflect normal kidney function, especially in states of heart failure or liver disease, where affected patients frequently have poor nutritional status, low muscle mass, weight loss, and edema.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The evaluation of renal function in individuals who are to undergo a nonrenal SOT begins with a complete history and physical examination, an accurate measure of renal function, a urinalysis, and kidney imaging study [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34250/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Based on findings from this initial evaluation, renal biopsy, and other studies may be required.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      History and physical examination &mdash; The level of kidney function and duration of kidney disease prior to organ transplantation is an important risk factor for post-transplant CKD. It is essential to determine what the baseline serum creatinine concentration level was six months to a year prior to the current evaluation as well as the presence or absence of proteinuria at that time. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may be primarily due to deterioration in underlying heart, lung, or liver disease and is frequently compromised by poor effective circulating volume (eg, low cardiac output in advanced heart failure or hepatorenal syndrome in liver candidates). In these situations, kidney function may improve after replacement of the nonrenal failing organ.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Measure of renal function &mdash; The serum creatinine level may not accurately reflect renal function especially in patients with advanced liver disease or advanced heart failure. Since the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is one of the main predictors of renal function following nonrenal SOT, failure to accurately estimate GFR by the use of serum creatinine alone may result in unrealistic expectations of what kidney function will be after the transplant. Patients with a serum creatinine above 1",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       mg/dl",
"      </span>",
"      warrant further evaluation. (See",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?35/45/36570?source=see_link\">",
"       \"Assessment of kidney function\"",
"      </a>",
"      .)",
"      <br/>",
"      <br/>",
"      As an example, in a large cohort study, I(125) iothalamate GFR measurements were performed in 1447 liver transplant candidates before transplantation, and comparison of this \"gold standard\" measurement was made to estimate the GFR based upon the serum creatinine concentration using the MDRD, Cockcroft-Gault and Nankivell formulas [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34250/abstract/7\">",
"       7",
"      </a>",
"      ]. The mean pre-transplant creatinine was 1.15",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       mg/dL,",
"      </span>",
"      and the mean iothalamate GFR was 91",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       mL/min.",
"      </span>",
"      Of all formulas, the six-variable MDRD fared best, although it lacked precision in that only 66 percent of estimates were within 30 percent of the measured GFR. When patients were divided into two groups according to GFR more or less than 40",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       mL/min,",
"      </span>",
"      all the formulas overestimated GFR in the patients with poor function (GFR &lt;40",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       mL/min),",
"      </span>",
"      while the formulas underestimated GFR in patients with better function (GFR &gt;40",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       mL/min).",
"      </span>",
"      Despite this, the use of the MDRD or the Cockcroft-Gault formulas to estimate GFR may provide a better assessment of kidney function than the serum creatinine concentration alone [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34250/abstract/8\">",
"       8",
"      </a>",

"      .)",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A 24-hour collection for the creatinine clearance is also likely to overestimate GFR in patients with renal disease as the contribution of tubular secretion of creatinine to total clearance is increased in this subset of patients. This was best shown in a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies of 193 patients with liver cirrhosis in which the measured creatinine clearance was compared with true GFR (as assessed by inulin clearance) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34250/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Overall, the measured creatinine clearance overestimated inulin clearance by a mean of 13",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/min",
"    </span>",
"    per 1.73 m2, with the overestimation being highest in those with the lowest true GFRs. Among those with inulin clearance of less than 30",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/min",
"    </span>",
"    per 1.73 m2 (stage 4 and 5 CKD), the measured creatinine clearance correctly classified 64 percent of patients, incorrectly classified 23 percent of patients as having GFRs between 30 to 59",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/min",
"    </span>",
"    per 1.73 m2, and incorrectly classified 14 percent as having GFRs &ge;60",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mL/min",
"    </span>",
"    per 1.73 m2. Another method to help estimate the GFR in these patients is to average both the creatinine and urea clearances.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    More accurate methods of estimating GFR rely on the renal clearance of various radionuclide markers, including 99mTc-labeled DTPA, 51Cr-labeled EDTA, and 125I-labeled iothalamate [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34250/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, these methods are of limited availability, usually costly, and require radiation exposure. There is also emerging evidence that cystatin C levels (which are also of limited availability) are a more sensitive indicator of kidney function than the serum creatinine concentration in patients with liver or heart disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?33/28/34250/abstract/11-13\">",
"     11-13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, using 51Cr-labeled EDTA-measured GFR as the reference, a study that included 254 blood samples from 65 cirrhotic patients demonstrated that the estimated GFR using cystatin C-based formulas was no better than creatinine-based equations [",
