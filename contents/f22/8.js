"       What is incontinence?",

"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&ldquo;Incontinence&rdquo; is the term doctors use when a person leaks urine or loses bladder control. Incontinence is a very common problem, but it is",
"      <strong>",
"       not",
"      </strong>",
"      a normal part of aging. If you have this problem, you do not have to &ldquo;just live with it.&rdquo; There are treatments and things you can do on your own to stop or reduce urine leakage.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280086\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What are the symptoms of incontinence?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There are different types of incontinence. Each causes different symptoms. The 3 most common types are:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Stress incontinence:",
"        </strong>",
"        People with stress incontinence leak urine when they laugh, cough, sneeze or do anything that &ldquo;stresses&rdquo; the belly. Stress incontinence is most common in women, especially those who have had a baby.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Urge incontinence",
"        </strong>",
"        : People with urge incontinence feel a strong need to urinate all of a sudden. Often the &ldquo;urge&rdquo; is so strong that they can&rsquo;t make it to the bathroom in time. (If you have these sudden urges but do not leak urine, you might have an &ldquo;overactive bladder.&rdquo; That can also be treated.)",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Mixed incontinence",
"        </strong>",
"        : People with mixed incontinence have symptoms of both stress and urge incontinence.",

"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280093\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yes. Here are some steps that can help reduce urine leaks:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        Reduce the amount of liquid you drink, especially a few hours before bed.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Cut down on any foods or drinks that make your symptoms worse. Some people find that alcohol, caffeine, or spicy or acidic foods irritate the bladder.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Lose weight, if you are overweight.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible, if you have diabetes.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        If you take medicines called diuretics, plan ahead. These medicines increase the need to urinate. Take them when you know you will be near a bathroom for a few hours.",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      These techniques can also help improve bladder control:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Bladder retraining:",
"        </strong>",
"        During bladder retraining, you go to the bathroom at scheduled times. For instance, you might decide that you will go every hour. You would make yourself go every hour, even if you didn&rsquo;t feel like you needed to. And you would try to wait until a whole hour had passed if you needed to go sooner. Then, once you got used to going every hour, you would increase the amount of time you waited in between bathroom visits. Over time, you might be able to &ldquo;retrain&rdquo; your bladder to wait 3 or 4 hours between bathroom visits.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Pelvic muscle exercises:",
"        </strong>",
"        Pelvic muscle exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine. These exercises can help, but people often do them wrong. Ask your doctor or nurse how to do them right.",

"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Should I see my doctor or nurse?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Yes. Your doctor or nurse can find out what might be causing your incontinence. He or she can also suggest ways to relieve the problem.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      When you speak to your doctor or nurse, ask if any of the medicines you take could be causing your symptoms. Some medicines can cause incontinence or make it worse.",

"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       How is incontinence treated?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The treatment options differ depending on what type of incontinence you have, and whether you are a man or a woman. Some of the treatment options include:",

"      <ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        Medicines to relax the bladder",

"      SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Chemotherapy refers to the use of medicines to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells. It is the mainstay of treatment for small cell lung cancer. Chemotherapy works by interfering with the ability of rapidly growing cells (like cancer cells) to divide or reproduce themselves. Because most of an adult's normal cells are not actively growing, they are not affected as much by chemotherapy, with the exception of bone marrow (where the blood cells are produced), the hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Effects of chemotherapy on these and other normal tissues gives rise to side effects during treatment (see",
"     <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H9\">",
"      'Side effects'",
"     </a>",
"     below).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     A number of chemotherapy drugs are active against small cell lung cancer, and many new drugs are being explored. A single chemotherapy drug may be used to treat small cell lung cancer, although more commonly combination therapy (the combined use of two or more chemotherapy drugs given together) is used. This improves the chance of reducing the size of the tumor (termed a response to therapy), and modestly lengthens survival. Chemotherapy is usually administered as an injection into the vein (intravenously), although some agents can be given by mouth.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Generally speaking, chemotherapy is administered over a one to three day period, usually every three weeks, and then restarted again. The waiting period is necessary to allow the effects of the drugs on normal tissues to subside before administering more chemotherapy. The short period of drug administration followed by the waiting period is called one \"cycle\" of chemotherapy.",

"      Duration of treatment",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The optimal duration of initial chemotherapy for patients with small cell lung cancer is not well defined. The number of cycles is determined by how the cancer is responding to treatment, and how the patient's body tolerates the treatment. Typically, four to six cycles of chemotherapy are recommended. Additional cycles of chemotherapy (called maintenance chemotherapy) have not been shown to significantly improve survival or quality of life.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The most important side effect of chemotherapy is a transient drop in the blood counts due to the effect of chemotherapy on the bone marrow. This typically occurs one to two weeks after a dose of chemotherapy is given. During this time, the patient or a family member should report any fever or chills to the physician; having low blood counts can increase a person's chances of developing infections, such as pneumonia.",

"      SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER RADIATION THERAPY",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Radiation therapy (RT) is often recommended during chemotherapy for people with limited small cell lung cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) involves the use of focused, high energy x-rays to destroy cancer cells. The x-rays are delivered from a machine (called a linear accelerator) that is outside of the patient, and individual treatments are brief (typically 10 to 15 minutes) and not painful.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The damaging effect of radiation is cumulative, and a certain amount of radiation must be delivered before the cancer cells are so damaged that they die. To accomplish this, small radiation doses are administered daily, five days per week, for five to seven weeks. Sometimes, for patients with limited stage disease, radiation is delivered twice daily, five days per week, for three weeks. Radiation is only administered to the areas of the body that are affected by the tumor. Thus, in contrast to chemotherapy, which is a systemic or body-wide treatment, radiation is a local treatment, and side effects are generally limited to the area undergoing radiation.",

"      Chest radiation",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Studies of patients with limited stage lung disease have shown that RT to the chest can help decrease the chance of the tumor regrowing in the chest (a recurrence) after chemotherapy. Furthermore, the use of radiation may improve the likelihood of surviving the cancer by approximately five percent [",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The best way of combining chest RT with chemotherapy is a matter of debate, although in general, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are usually started at the same time (called concurrent therapy). Chest RT can sometimes be given after chemotherapy has been completed (called sequential therapy).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     With concurrent therapy, the side effects of both treatments are usually more pronounced (eg, lowering of the blood counts, difficulty swallowing due to inflammation of the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis), and inflammation of the normal lung surrounding the tumor (pneumonitis)). However, most experts believe that the benefit of each treatment is greater when they are given concurrently.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Side effects related to radiation occur gradually over the weeks of treatment. They include fatigue, possible mild skin reddening of the chest, and esophageal symptoms characterized by an initial feeling of a &ldquo;lump in one&rsquo;s throat&rdquo; when swallowing and eventually, a sore throat (esophagitis). The esophageal symptoms are closely monitored and treated with appropriate pain medications. Long-term side effects occur many months after radiation has been completed and include scarring of normal lung, which can be seen on follow up chest CT scans and is sometimes associated with shortness of breath.",

"      Brain radiation",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The brain is a common site of tumor spread (termed metastasis) in people with small cell lung cancer. Having preventive radiation treatment of the brain after chemotherapy, before evidence of metastases develop, substantially reduces the chances of developing brain metastases and prolongs survival [",

"      2,3",

"      3",
"     </a>",
"     ].",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Using modern techniques, PCI causes a tolerable level of short term side effects, including redness and itching of the scalp, fatigue, and hair loss, all of which are usually self-limited. Long-term side effects may include mild neurologic and intellectual difficulties (including short-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating). The likelihood of these long-term effects is lessened when PCI and chemotherapy are given at different times.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     In patients who already have spread of small cell lung cancer to the brain and in those who subsequently develop brain metastases, radiation therapy to the brain is often recommended to control symptoms.",

"     Because small cell lung cancer spreads quickly, surgery to remove the lung tumor generally does not improve the probability or length of survival. However, it may be beneficial in a small number (less than 10 percent) of patients who are diagnosed very early in the course of their disease. In these patients, surgery followed by chemotherapy can result in a five-year survival rate of up to 35 to 40 percent.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     A thin tube is inserted through the skin of the chest wall and into the mediastinum, the central portion of the chest that represents the space between the right and left lung (",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Chemotherapy is of clear benefit in patients with small cell lung cancer. Without chemotherapy, the average survival is measured in weeks. The likelihood of responding to chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is quite high. Response rates of 80 to 100 percent are seen in patients with limited disease, and approximately one-half of these are complete (no remaining evidence of the cancer by either physical examination or x-ray studies) [",
"     <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22659/abstract/4,5\">",
"      4,5",
"     </a>",
"     ]. With extensive stage disease, 60 to 80 percent of patients will respond to chemotherapy, and between 15 and 40 percent will have a complete response.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Despite these favorable results, small cell lung cancer tends to recur or relapse within one to two years in the majority of patients, particularly those with extensive stage disease. If the small cell lung cancer recurs or fails to respond to one type of chemotherapy regimen, a different type of chemotherapy regimen may offer some relief from symptoms and a modest improvement in survival.",

"      Smoking cessation",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The importance of quitting smoking cannot be overemphasized, particularly for patients with limited stage disease. Patients who continue to smoke do less well. One reason is that if they survive their first lung cancer, they have a substantial chance of developing a second lung cancer because of smoking. Furthermore, treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery can cause lung damage. It is therefore important to have the best lung function possible prior to and after receiving treatment. Thus, if at all possible, patients should stop smoking. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Gastrointestinal hormones are predominantly polypeptides produced in and secreted from specialized gut endocrine cells. In the intestine, these cells are scattered throughout the mucosa and, even though they may be more concentrated in one region, such as the proximal small intestine, they do not form glands. Accordingly, it has been difficult to study GI endocrine cells in vivo or in vitro. The availability of molecular tools has provided new information on the mechanisms endocrine cells use to synthesize peptides, and the potential for their manipulation in the treatment of certain diseases.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The synthesis, secretion, and regulation gastrointestinal peptides will be discussed here. An overview of gastrointestinal peptides in health and disease is discussed separately. (See",

"     SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;All gastrointestinal peptides are synthesized via gene transcription of DNA into mRNA and subsequent translation into precursor proteins known as preprohormones. Translation occurs on ribosomes, which are complex organelles composed of many proteins (greater than 50) and multiple large RNA molecules [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Posttranslational processing",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Posttranslational modifications of peptide hormones are important in receptor binding, signal transduction, and consequent cell responses, all of which may affect biological activity [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Preprohormones undergo intracellular processing in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and packaging in the Golgi apparatus prior to release, and are then stored in secretory granules as hormones (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50859 \" href=\"UTD.htm?22/24/22926\">",
"     figure 1",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Some peptides undergo further modification while in the secretory granule. The amino terminal sequence of a gastrointestinal preprohormone contains a signal peptide that targets it for secretion. Enzymatic cleavage of the signal peptide produces a prohormone. Signal peptide cleavage and the vast majority of peptide modifications occur in the endoplasmic reticulum.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Other posttranslational modifications are specific to the particular hormone. Some undergo peptide cleavage to smaller forms (eg, somatostatin), amidation of the carboxyl terminus (eg, gastrin), and sulfation of tyrosine residues (eg, cholecystokinin [CCK]). These processing steps are usually critical for biological activity of the hormone [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. As an example, sulfated CCK is 100-fold more potent than its unsulfated form.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In addition, many hormone genes are capable of manufacturing alternatively spliced mRNAs or proteins that undergo different posttranslational processing steps (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50859 \" href=\"UTD.htm?22/24/22926\">",

"     figure 2",
"    </a>",
"    ), ultimately producing hormones of different sizes from the same gene. Gastrin and CCK exist in multiple molecular forms in blood and tissues.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The biochemical complexity of gastroenteropancreatic hormone processing is evident in the different tissues that produce these peptides. Many gastrointestinal hormones are secreted from endocrine cells as well as nerves. The distinct tissue involved often determines the processing steps for production of the hormone.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Secretion",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Many gut endocrine cells have their apical surfaces open to the intestinal lumen and contain abundant secretory granules that are concentrated along the basolateral surfaces. Because of this orientation, endocrine cells can be directly influenced by luminal contents. When endocrine cells are stimulated, mature hormone is secreted into the paracellular space. From this location, hormones can be taken up into the circulation where they are able to bind to receptors on distant target tissues (endocrine action), or remain in the surrounding tissue space for cell-to-cell communication (paracrine action). Somatostatin producing D-cells have cellular processes that extend to neighboring cells. These have been best demonstrated in the stomach where D cells contact gastrin-producing G cells in the antrum and inhibit gastrin release. Two other types of enteroendocrine cells (CCK-producing I cells and PYY-producing L cells) also possess basal processes that extend to epithelial cells and penetrate the lamina propria to reach subepithelial cells [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/5,6\">",
"     5,6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. It is likely that these processes allow I and L cells to directly communicate with other nearby cells.",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     REGULATION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;All cellular proteins are regulated at the genetic level. The biochemical information that encodes for the production of proteins resides in the genome, in defined regions of specific chromosomes. As an example, the gene for gastrin has been isolated to chromosome 17. The genes for most gastrointestinal peptides have been cloned. (See",

"   <p>",
"    Specific gene regulatory elements determine if and when a protein is produced, and the particular cell in which it will be expressed. Gut hormone gene expression is regulated according to the physiologic needs of the organism. The production of gastrointestinal hormones increases when gut endocrine cells are stimulated by food, intraluminal pH, releasing factors, other hormones or transmitters. Once a biologic response is elicited, signals may then be sent to the endocrine cell to turn off hormone secretion. This negative feedback mechanism is common to many physiologic systems and avoids excess production and secretion of hormone.",

"     THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The ability to manipulate peptide hormones on a genetic level has many therapeutic implications. The following are two examples that already have had impact at the bedside:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Expression of human genes in other species such as pigs or sheep permits these animals to secrete human hormones for medicinal use [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/7,8\">",
"       7,8",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Human insulin, clotting factors and growth hormone are routinely prepared in this fashion.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Drugs are being developed that inhibit the transcription of DNA into mRNA, or block the gene elements responsible for turning on specific protein production (antisense oligonucleotides) [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/9-11\">",
"       9-11",
"      </a>",
"      ]. This technology is based upon the principle that nucleotide sequences can be identified that bind to particular regions of DNA that are unique for the gene of interest and prevent transcription into mRNA. Furthermore, oligonucleotides can be made that interact with mRNA and inhibit translation of a protein product [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22660/abstract/12\">",
"       12",
"      </a>",
"      ]. RNA interference strategies may be applicable to the treatment of the growing list of endocrine diseases that result from aberrant protein processing [",

"       13,14",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Presently, the use of antisense oligonucleotides for patient care is limited to clinical trials of experimental compounds. However, several products may become available: an oligonucleotide to treat CMV retinitis, small interfering RNAs directed against vascular endothelial growth factor to treat age-related macular degeneration, and an agent to treat Crohn's disease [",

"      Specific gene regulatory elements determine if a gut peptide is produced, and the particular cell in which it will be expressed. Gut hormone gene expression is regulated according to the physiologic needs of the organism. The production of gastrointestinal hormones increases when gut endocrine cells are stimulated by food, intraluminal pH, releasing factors, other hormones or transmitters. Once a biologic response is elicited, signals may then be sent to the endocrine cell to turn off hormone secretion. This negative feedback mechanism avoids excess production and secretion of hormone. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Regulation'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The ability to manipulate peptide hormones on a genetic level has many therapeutic implications. Drugs are being developed that inhibit the transcription of DNA into mRNA, or block the gene elements responsible for turning on specific protein production (antisense oligonucleotides). Presently, the use of antisense oligonucleotides for patient care is limited to clinical trials of experimental compounds. (See",

"      The curvature of the fetal spine is oriented downward (also called \"back-down\" or dorsoinferior), such that the fetal shoulder presents at the cervix (",

"     INCIDENCE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Transverse fetal lie occurs in approximately one in 300 deliveries [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22662/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In contrast, the fetus is often found in a transverse lie when ultrasound examination is performed early in gestation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22662/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     NATURAL HISTORY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Most fetuses in transverse lie early in pregnancy convert to a cephalic (or breech) presentation by term. The later in pregnancy the transverse lie is diagnosed, the more likely it is to persist. This was illustrated in a series of 235 patients with transverse fetal lie incidentally discovered by sonography at more than 20 weeks gestation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22662/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. When the diagnosis was first made between 20 to 25 weeks of gestation, 2.6 percent persisted as transverse lie at term. By comparison, when the diagnosis was first made at 36 to 40 weeks, 11.8 percent persisted to the time of delivery.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In another series of 29 patients with transverse lie at 37 weeks of gestation, 24 (83 percent) spontaneously converted to a longitudinal lie and presented in labor with either a vertex (15) or breech (9) presentation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22662/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Transverse lie persisted in the five (17 percent) remaining patients. Overall, the cesarean delivery rate was 13 of 29 (45 percent); indications were breech in eight and transverse lie in five.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     ETIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A number of theories have been proposed to account for fetal position within the uterus and the eventual cephalic presentation of most fetuses as pregnancy reaches term.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Gravity and fetal comfort are factors that have been suggested as playing important roles [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22662/abstract/6\">",
"     6",

"    ]. Early in pregnancy when the volume of amniotic fluid is relatively large in relation to the volume of the fetus, the fetus is often found in a noncephalic presentation. As pregnancy continues and the volume of amniotic fluid diminishes in relationship to fetal size, the fetus is usually found in a longitudinal orientation with the greatest mass of the fetus (the buttocks and flexed thighs) in the fundal area of the uterus. The longitudinal lie presents a body axis posture along the line of gravity and with the least constriction to overall fetal movement.",

Transverse lie should be suspected if firm resistance of the fetal head is not detected above the symphysis pubis and can be diagnosed when further palpation confirms the position of fetal head in one or the other of the mother's flanks. Location of the fetal back (up or down) may be more difficult, especially if the patient is obese. Sensitivity for detecting non-cephalic presentation (breech, oblique, or transverse lie) by abdominal palpation at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation is only 70 percent. Although the accuracy of detecting transverse lie by abdominal palpation is likely to be greater than for breech presentation, the sensitivity for detecting transverse lie by abdominal palpation is not known because the incidence of this abnormal presentation is too low to conduct a robust study [",

The incidence of cesarean delivery was lower among women managed actively (11 versus 40 percent). Therefore, based on the small amount of data available, it appears that active intervention at &ge;37 weeks of gestation will result in fewer perinatal deaths from spontaneous rupture of membranes and cord prolapse than expectant management, and also offers the mother, who is often a multiparous patient, a higher likelihood of vaginal delivery.

However, surgery is required in children with open fractures, bony fragments that are incarcerated in the elbow joint, or complete ulnar nerve deficit. Lateral epicondylar fractures are rare and do not require surgical intervention [",

"    Transphyseal fractures are relatively uncommon fractures seen in infants and young children. They are associated with child abuse and birth trauma. Proper orthopedic treatment typically requires closed reduction with percutaneous pinning. Diagnosis of a transphyseal elbow fracture in a child with no plausible mechanism of injury should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child abuse), if available, and reporting of suspected child abuse to proper authorities, as required.",

"      Epicondylar elbow fractures most commonly occur in older boys after a fall on an outstretched arm. Medial epicondylar fractures comprise 10 percent of all elbow fractures in children. Many of these fractures may be managed with splinting and early active motion. However, surgery is required in children with open fractures, bony fragments that are incarcerated in the elbow joint, or complete ulnar nerve deficit. Lateral epicondylar fractures are rare and do not require surgical intervention. (See",

"       image 2",
"      </a>",
"      ). However, an intraarticular epicondylar fracture fragment may be difficult to see. In these cases, the absence of the epicondyle and an irregular elbow joint space on radiographs are the major clues to the injury (",

"      Transphyseal fractures are relatively uncommon distal humeral fractures seen in neonates, infants, and young children. They are associated with child abuse and birth trauma. Proper orthopedic treatment typically requires closed reduction with percutaneous pinning. (See",

"     <li>",
"      Transphyseal fractures may be difficult to identify on the standard three view plain radiograph (AP, lateral, and oblique), especially in children &lt;5 years of age in whom the involved areas are not ossified. A fat pad sign is typically present. Comparison views with the unaffected elbow may be helpful in this circumstance (",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Transphyseal fractures are also difficult to distinguish radiographically from elbow dislocations. In the transphyseal fracture, the alignment of the radial head and the capitellum is preserved (",

"      Diagnosis of a transphyseal elbow fracture in a child with no plausible mechanism of injury should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child abuse), if available, and reporting of suspected child abuse to proper authorities, as required.

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder manifested by motor and phonic tics with onset during childhood [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Although TS is the most common cause of tics, there are many potential etiologies in the differential diagnosis, including neuroacanthocytosis, drugs such as dopamine receptor blocking agents and cocaine, pervasive developmental disorder, and others [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic will review Tourette syndrome. Other hyperkinetic movement disorders are discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?17/40/18058?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATHOGENESIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;TS was thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but the mode of inheritance may be more complex. In most cases a bilineal transmission (inheritance from both parents) is clearly evident [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The disorder likely results from a disturbance in the striatal-thalamic-cortical (mesolimbic) spinal system, which leads to disinhibition of the motor and limbic system [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although the genetic basis remains elusive, several loci have been identified as candidate susceptibility regions [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The discovery of a mutation in the SLITRK1 gene on chromosome 13q31.1 was a major advance in the search for the elusive TS gene or genes [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The SLITRK1 gene is expressed in brain regions previously implicated in TS (cortex, hippocampus, thalamic, subthalamic and globus pallidus nuclei, striatum, and cerebellum) and it appears to play a role in dendritic growth. However, it is not clear how the altered gene product leads to the complex neurobehavioral disorder. This mutation appears to be a rare cause of TS as it has not been found in hundreds of TS patients tested.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Another possible rare genetic cause of TS is a mutation in the HDC gene on chromosome 15q21-q22, as detected in two generations of a family with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of TS [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The HDC gene encodes for L-histidine decarboxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of histamine from histidine. In the central nervous system, histaminergic neurons are located in the posterior hypothalamus but have widespread axonal connections to other brain regions [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These findings suggest the possibility of using pharmacologic manipulation of histaminergic neurotransmission to treat TS [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, it is unknown how histamine abnormalities might cause or contribute to TS symptoms.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Neuropathologic examinations have detected no consistent brain abnormalities in patients with TS, but a number of neuroimaging studies have found evidence of structural or metabolic changes in the brain [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/10\">",

"      A study using volumetric MRI found that gray matter volumes in the left frontal lobes were smaller in patients with TS than in controls, supporting the loss of the normal left &gt; right asymmetry in this condition [",

"       12",

"    Although it has been proposed that antibodies to basal ganglia neurons from Group A streptococcal infection may contribute to pathogenesis of TS in some patients, there is little or no evidence that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) plays a role in the development of TS. This issue is discussed separately. (See",

"     CLINICAL FEATURES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Tics are the clinical hallmark of TS. The onset of TS is typically is between 2 and 15 years, although the diagnosis may be delayed until 21 years in some cases. The disorder is manifested by 11 years of age in 96 percent of patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In a large international registry of 3500 patients with TS, tics began at an average of 6.4 years [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. More males than females were affected (4.3:1). TS was the sole diagnosis in only 12 percent of cases.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Tics resolve by age 18 in about half of patients with TS [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/16\">",
"     16",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Although tics may persist into adulthood, their severity usually diminishes gradually over time. Nonetheless, the most common cause of \"adult-onset\" tics is TS that remits after puberty and reappears as tics later in life [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/17\">",
"     17",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Other causes of tics seen in adults are less common [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In a meta-analysis of 13 studies that specifically assessed TS in children, the prevalence of TS was 7.7 per 1000 children (95% CI 3.9-1.51) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/18\">",
"     18",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The prevalence was higher in boys compared with girls (10.6 versus 2.5 per 1000).",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Tics",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Tics are sudden, brief, intermittent movements (motor tics) or utterances (vocal or phonic tics). Tics have been considered involuntary, but tics can temporarily be voluntarily suppressed [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/1,19\">",
"     1,19",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The tics in TS can be categorized as either simple or complex. Simple tics include eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head jerking. Many patients have complex sequences of coordinated movements, including bizarre gait, kicking, jumping, body gyrations, scratching, and seductive or obscene gestures. Certain characteristics of the tics, including the waxing and waning nature, the irresistible urge before and relief after a tic, and the temporary suppressibility may result in the mistaken diagnosis of a psychogenic disorder. One of the most characteristic features of tics is the presence of premonitory feelings or sensations, which are relieved by the execution of the tic [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/20\">",
"     20",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Involuntary vocalizations, ranging from simple noises to coprolalia (obscene words), echolalia (repetition of words), and palilalia (repetition of a phrase or word with increasing rapidity), frequently occur. Coprolalia occurs in approximately 40 percent of cases [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Many patients also experience copropraxia (obscene gestures), echopraxia (mimicking of gestures), bizarre thoughts and ideas, thought fixation, compulsive ruminations, and perverse sexual fantasies. Approximately one-half of our patients have sleep complaints, including restlessness, insomnia, enuresis, somnambulism, nightmares, and bruxism. Motor tics were recorded during sleep by polysomnography in approximately two-thirds.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Violent or forceful neck tics in patients with TS rarely have been associated with injuries including cervical disc herniation, compressive and noncompressive myelopathy, and cervical artery dissection with stroke [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/8/22664/abstract/21-26\">",
"     21-26",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, some experts advocate more aggressive management of severe forceful neck tics, including the use of botulinum toxin injections or even deep brain stimulation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Comorbidity",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Comorbidity in TS is frequent. In a large international registry of 3500 patients with TS, comorbid conditions included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (60 percent), obsessive compulsive disorder (27 percent), obsessive compulsive behavior (32 percent), learning disorder (23 percent), and conduct",

"    ]. Patients with more comorbidities were more likely to have behavioral problems such as sleep difficulties, coprolalia, self-injurious behavior, and anger control problems. Motor and vocal manifestations were more frequent in boys, whereas girls were more likely to have behavioral problems such as OCD.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The association of behavior disorders with tics in a community-based study was similar to clinic-based reports. In a study of school children aged 9 to 17 years, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders were significantly more common in children with than without tics and with than without TS [",

"    Where available, we suggest behavioral therapy with HRT for patients with TS and bothersome tics who either prefer nonpharmacologic treatment or who have not tolerated or responded to pharmacologic interventions. However, several limitations apply. The success of this behavioral management is critically dependent on active involvement of the parents and the therapist, both of whom must be well trained and skilled in the various HRT techniques. Given the demands on time and effort on the part of the patient, the therapist, and parents, it is unlikely that all parties will be able to maintain the needed compliance with the training program to provide sustained benefit. There is also some concern as to whether the mental effort required to fully comply with the various components of HRT could actually interfere with patient's attention and learning.",

"    While there has been a great deal of effort exerted over the last several decades making the scientific, clinical, and lay community understand the biological basis of TS, the reported response to behavioral therapy may be misinterpreted by some as evidence that tics and TS are of psychological etiology. This is one reason why behavioral therapies are often not covered by insurance or other third party payers. Thus, only a limited number of patients will be able to access this behavioral therapy as compared to pharmacologic treatment, which actually may be more effective.",

"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Tourette syndrome (TS) is a common movement and neurobehavioral disorder in children characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The genetic basis of TS remains elusive, but several loci have been identified as candidate susceptibility regions. Mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene and the HDC gene appear to be rare causes of TS. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Pathogenesis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The onset of TS is typically between age 2 and 15 years and occurs by 11 years of age in 96 percent of patients. However, the diagnosis may be delayed until 21 years in some cases. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H3\">",
"       'Clinical features'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Common comorbid conditions in TS include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), disordered impulse control and other behavioral problems. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Comorbidity'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The diagnosis of TS is based on the clinical features, particularly the presence of multiple motor and vocal tics, with onset before age 21. The diagnosis is often supported by the presence of coexisting behavioral disorders such as ADHD",
"      <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"       and/or",
"      </span>",
"      OCD, and a family history of similar symptoms. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H8\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Pharmacotherapy is indicated only when symptoms of TS are interfering with social interactions, school or job performance, or activities of daily living. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H10\">",
"       'Management'",

"     INTRODUCTION",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common malignancies in the United States and other economically developed countries. At current rates, approximately 6 percent of individuals will develop this malignancy in their lifetime. Approximately one-half of individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer will die from it. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?41/25/42394?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The risk of colorectal cancer can be reduced by screening, recommendations for which have been issued by several major medical organizations. (See",

"     \"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In addition, several protective factors have been identified, stimulating interest in primary prevention. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?41/25/42394?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors\"",

"   </p>",

"    Among the protective agents are",
"    <a class=\"drug drug_general\" href=\"UTD.htm?24/7/24698?source=see_link\">",
"     aspirin",
"    </a>",
"    and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A large and compelling body of research has shown that NSAIDs inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis. The evidence is diverse and is based upon animal models, epidemiologic data, intervention trials of NSAIDs in patients with familial polyposis, and, more recently, randomized controlled trials of aspirin and selective COX-2 inhibitors in humans.",

"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. One of the unexpected findings was an inverse association between aspirin use and risk of colorectal cancer. The association persisted even when the investigators controlled for potential confounding factors, leading the authors to speculate that this inverse association could be causal.",

Overall, protocol adherence was poor, with only 55 percent of the initial patients undergoing a year four protocol colonoscopy.

Patients allocated to receive aspirin for five years or longer had an absolute risk reduction for colon cancer of approximately 70 percent. Doses of 75 mg daily appeared to be as effective as higher doses, although there were no individual trials that directly compared 75 mg with higher doses; very low doses of aspirin (30 mg daily) were ineffective.

Another possible explanation is that the study follow-up was only two to four years (median 29 months), which may have been too brief to detect a benefit of aspirin. In support of this explanation, a planned double-blinded, post-intervention follow-up of patients enrolled in CAPP2 (median 56 months) found a marginal nonsignificant reduction in colorectal cancer incidence in an intent-to-treat analysis. However, in a per protocol analysis of patients treated with 600 mg aspirin per day for at least two years, there was a significant reduction in colorectal cancer incidence.

Consistent with this hypothesis is a study in which human colon cancer cells that expressed high levels of COX-2 were implanted into nude mice; treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduced tumor formation by 85 to 90 percent and inhibited colony formation of cultured cells [",

"     104",

Administration of a COX-2 selective antagonist inhibited the growth of these cells by both inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. However, in another study, a different COX-2 selective antagonist induced apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line that lacked detectable COX-2 expression, suggesting that COX-2 selective NSAIDs may induce apoptosis via mechanisms that do not involve COX-2 [",

Prostaglandin E2 is a potent stimulator of cultured colon cancer cells via a G-protein-coupled receptor leading to accumulation of beta-catenin (which stimulates cell proliferation) in the nucleus. Thus, NSAIDs may exert a beneficial effect by decreasing production of prostaglandin E2 and leading to increased degradation of beta-catenin [",

However, the finding that relatively low doses of daily aspirin typically used for prevention of atherothrombosis may also be associated with lower risk of death from cancers has supported a hypothesis that aspirin may mediate additional anti-cancer mechanisms through inhibition of COX-1 present in platelets [",
