"     Vasectomy is a safe, effective, and permanent method of birth control for men. It is also the most cost-effective form of birth control, costing half as much as a tubal ligation (having a woman's \"tubes tied\"). In the United States, one out of five men over the age of 35 has had a vasectomy.",

"     Sperm are produced in the testicles and then move into the epididymis, which sits on the upper surface of each testicle. Sperm are stored in the epididymis, where they mature and become capable of fertilization.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     At the time of ejaculation, the seminal fluid and sperm move from the epididymis through the vas deferens and are then expelled from the penis. The vas deferens are long, thin tubes that start in the scrotum and run behind the bladder and then return forward to empty into the urethra inside of the prostate gland; the urethra is the tube inside the penis that carries urine and semen.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     When a vasectomy is performed, the vas deferens are cut and sutured closed, preventing sperm from leaving the epididymis (",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The sperm count is checked, usually three months after the procedure, to ensure that no sperm remain in the ejaculate. A man needs to have ejaculated at least 20 times after vasectomy to clear the ducts of sperm before the follow-up sperm count.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     A sperm count requires that the man give a semen sample, usually obtained by masturbation. A man who continues to have sperm requires a second sperm count two months later.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If the follow-up check shows sperm that do not move, there is a small chance that a partner may become pregnant. Another method of contraception should be continued until &ldquo;special clearance&rdquo; is given by the doctor.",

"     Men frequently have a great deal of anxiety about vasectomy. Much of the anxiety is related to a fear of pain or damage to the penis or scrotum.

"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       To expose the vas, a small (less than one-half inch) incision is made with a scalpel. A no-scalpel technique can also be used. A loop of vas is brought to the surface and a small segment is removed (about 3 or 4 millimeters). The two cut surfaces of the vas are then either cauterized (treated with heat), tied off, or clipped. When one side is complete, the other side is treated.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       The skin edges are then closed with stitches or surgical staples. There will be a small scar from the incision, but this will be barely visible once healed.",

"     After the vasectomy, there will be some cramping and discomfort at the incision site. This can be relieved with a pain medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol&reg;). Ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided for at least one week because these medications may increase the risk of bruising or bleeding around the incision. For more severe pain, a stronger pain medication may be prescribed. Most men find that they do not need the stronger medication.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Bleeding &mdash; Excessive bleeding occurs in less than 5 percent of men who undergo vasectomy. Most bleeding problems occur within the first 48 hours after the procedure. Bleeding within the scrotum can lead to a hematoma, which is an expanding mass of blood within the tissues around the vas. This can grow to a large size if not treated promptly.",
"       <br/>",
"       <br/>",
"       Men can help to prevent bleeding by avoiding aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least one week prior to surgery, and by following the instructions regarding rest and limited activity after surgery.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Infection &mdash; Infection occurs in up to 4 percent of men who undergo vasectomy. This typically involves the scrotal skin around the incision. Occasionally, the epididymis will become swollen after a vasectomy. This is usually treated with a short course of oral antibiotics.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Sperm granuloma &mdash; A sperm granuloma occurs in 15 to 40 percent of men who undergo vasectomy. A sperm granuloma is a mass that develops over time as a result of the body's immune reaction to sperm leaking from the cut end of the vas. It is typically treated with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen. The mass is not dangerous. There are instances, however, in which a sperm granuloma causes significant scrotal discomfort. This may be treated by surgically removing the granuloma.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Post vasectomy pain syndrome &mdash; A feeling of fullness from sperm congestion occurs in up to 6 percent of men after a vasectomy. This is due to stretching of the surface of the testicle (epididymis) from stored sperm cells. The full sensation usually resolves after a few weeks and requires no treatment, but a very small number of men may develop chronic pain which might require vasectomy reversal or other surgery.",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Vasectomy reversal is called a vasovasostomy. This is a microsurgical technique that reconnects the vas deferens. The success rate of this procedure depends upon the condition of the vas. As more time elapses from the time of the vasectomy, vasovasostomy is less likely to be successful (ie, result in pregnancy) [",

"      5,6",

"     <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29730/abstract/5\">",
"      5",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pregnancy is generally considered a period of emotional well-being for the woman and her family. However, for many women, pregnancy and motherhood are times of increased vulnerability to psychiatric conditions. Longitudinal studies have shown that pregnancy does not protect against the development of new onset major depression or relapse of existing major depressive illness [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29735/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Women who discontinue or reduce their doses of antidepressants are at particularly high risk.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Epidemiological surveys indicate that the lifetime prevalence of major depression is two times higher in adult women than in men [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29735/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Therefore, it is not surprising that depression is one of the most frequently encountered medical complications during pregnancy and postpartum [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29735/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In spite of the high risk of this illness in women, many clinicians fail to recognize, diagnose, and offer appropriate treatment for depression during pregnancy. This may be due, in part, to the fact that somatic symptoms of depression during pregnancy, such as changes in sleep and appetite, may be attributed to normal pregnancy-related changes in maternal physiology [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29735/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Even when women at risk for depression are identified, studies have shown that very few receive treatment [",

"      Point prevalence (ie, the measure of a condition in a population at a given point in time) of major depression alone ranged from 3.1 to 4.9 percent at different times during pregnancy and 1.0 to 5.9 percent at different times during the first postpartum year.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Point prevalence for major and minor depression ranged from 8.5 to 11.0 percent during pregnancy and 6.5 to 12.9 percent during the first year postpartum.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The period prevalence (ie, the measure of a condition in a population over a period of time; a combination of point prevalence and incidence) of depression at any time from conception to birth was 14 to 23 percent; the period prevalence at any time from birth to three months postpartum was 11 to 32 percent.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These prevalence estimates were not significantly different from those of similarly aged nonpregnant women.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality also found that major and minor depression occurred more often during the second trimester and postpartum than at other times; however, the confidence intervals were wide and there was significant variation among study designs, so it is not certain that depression peaks at these times [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29735/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Another meta-analysis found that depressive symptoms (as opposed to clinical depression) were more prevalent in the second trimester (13 percent) and third trimester (12 percent) than in the first trimester (7 percent) [",

The majority of studies in this area have not adequately controlled for severity of the maternal mood disorder, substance abuse (cigarettes, alcohol, illicit drugs), poor nutrition, and other confounders (eg, non-compliance with prenatal care, low maternal income, maternal weight and weight gain, maternal age) and have had small sample sizes. Therefore, the potential for direct adverse effects, such as miscarriage, teratogenicity, low birth weight, preeclampsia, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and hyperemesis gravidarum, has not been fully characterized. For example, an association between preterm birth and depression may be due to comorbid factors such as poor nutrition, smoking, use of other drugs, or elevated corticotropin releasing hormone [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There are few studies that specifically assessed the short- and long-term effects of maternal depression during pregnancy on offspring. Research on fetal and child development is often hampered by methodologic limitations. These include using heterogeneous populations, nonstandardized control groups, small samples, incomplete assessment of maternal mental health, inadequate controls for exposure to perinatal mental illness in either parent, and inadequate controls for maternal substance abuse (including alcohol and tobacco) and use of medications.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    One study has found that depressive symptoms may reduce fetal growth. In a community sample of pregnant women with clinically relevant depression who were not treated with antidepressants (N = 570) and pregnant women with few or no depressive symptoms (N = 7027; control group), fetal growth was examined with ultrasonography each trimester [",

"     37",
"    </a>",

Although growth of head circumference was initially reduced in fetuses from depressed mothers compared to controls, head circumference at birth was comparable. &nbsp;",
"   </p>",

"     41",
"    </a>",

The fetal programming hypothesis states that \"the environment in utero can alter the development of the fetus during particular sensitive periods, with a permanent effect on the phenotype\" [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29735/abstract/42\">",
"     42",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Different mechanisms may operate at different stages of development; gender also influences susceptibility. Antenatal stress may interfere with development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the limbic system, and the prefrontal cortex. Cortisol, which crosses the placenta, may be a prime mediator of these effects.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Another proposed explanation is that maternal mental health may affect fetal development via the neuroendocrine,",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     immune/inflammatory,",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The number of parentage test cases processed by laboratories in the United States is rapidly increasing due, in part, to advances in DNA and information technology. The AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) reported that 414,843 paternity tests were performed in 2008 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Physicians should become knowledgeable about DNA parentage testing, as they will undoubtedly face situations where they need to understand the process, results, accuracy, limitations, and implications of testing. Court-ordered parentage testing is becoming more common. In addition, patients will ask for these tests or for help with interpretation of test results since DNA testing is now directly available to the general public.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Regulation of DNA parentage testing laboratories is limited; external oversight and accreditation of these laboratories are voluntary. As a result, the quality, thoroughness, interpretation of results, and admissibility of the information in court from DNA parentage testing laboratories vary from laboratory to laboratory. In this environment, it is important that the physician and the patient abandon the pervasive belief that all DNA tests produce extremely accurate, totally conclusive, and irrefutable answers.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     APPLICATIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From a historical perspective, the primary objective of parentage testing was to determine whether a man accused of paternity (ie, alleged father) could be accurately excluded as the biological father of a given child. More than 99 percent of falsely accused men can be excluded of paternity by using systems of red cell antigens, serum proteins, red cell enzymes, and HLA [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Actual proof of paternity is not possible with any laboratory test because there is always a chance that another man could have the same test results as the alleged father since the number of markers tested is limited. However, advances in DNA technology have made it possible for DNA parentage testing to produce highly conclusive evidence of parentage or absence of parentage.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The most common situations in which parentage testing may be performed include:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Court ordered DNA analyses to determine responsibility for child support and custody rights. If the father is deceased, the test may be used to obtain Social Security, veteran's, or insurance benefits or settle an inheritance dispute for the child. Court ordered DNA analyses are also performed in criminal cases involving sexual abuse of a minor resulting in pregnancy.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Determination of a child's biological parents. These cases usually involve adoption, immigration, and citizenship issues. They may also be related to assisted reproduction procedures (eg, in vitro fertilization) or, rarely, newborns misidentified in the hospital or kidnapped.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Prenatal paternity testing for pregnant women who are unsure who has fathered their child.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Occasionally, laboratory test results reveal the unexpected finding that the father is not the biological father of a child. Management of this situation can be complicated, and is addressed below (see",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H22\">",
"     'Disclosure of false paternity'",
"    </a>",
"    below).",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     COST",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The laboratory fees for DNA paternity tests typically range from $400 to $600 in the United States; most insurance plans do not cover these costs. The cost of ultrasound examination plus amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling adds to the cost of prenatal paternity testing (by about $2000) and is not covered by insurance unless these tests are performed for standard indications, such as increased risk of Down syndrome or presence of a congenital anomaly.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Since DNA is present in most cells of the body, a variety of cell types may be collected for DNA parentage testing. Samples are usually obtained from the inside of the mouth with a cotton or a Dacron swab due to the ease of collection. Blood samples may also be submitted for testing; just a few drops of blood from a finger or a heel prick are sufficient. For prenatal DNA parentage testing, a fetal sample is collected from amniotic fluid (5 to 10 mL) by amniocentesis or by chorionic villus sampling (CVS); thus, prenatal DNA paternity testing can be performed as early as the late first trimester. The fetal cells can be submitted directly to the DNA testing laboratory, or they can be sent to a cytogenetics laboratory for culture before they are forwarded for paternity analysis. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis using cell free fetal DNA in maternal blood is possible, but remains investigational (see",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H1786280\">",
"     'Noninvasive prenatal paternity testing'",
"    </a>",
"    below).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Sample collection procedures are an integral part of the DNA parentage testing process. The legal ramifications of DNA parentage test results require that sample collections conform to strict chain-of-custody procedures. These collection procedures dictate the:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Selection of the person collecting the samples",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Documentation of the identity of the tested individuals",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Tracking of the sample during the collection and testing process",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Unfortunately, thousands of sample collections are performed for DNA parentage tests that do not conform to the documentation of identity and chain-of-custody procedures described below. As an example, numerous laboratories offer home testing kits that allow for anonymous testing and for sample collections without the involvement of laboratory personnel or other professionals. These tests are sometimes referred to as \"curiosity testing\" as opposed to \"court-approved tests.\"",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Collection personnel",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;An important first step in the proper collection of samples is the selection of the individual(s) performing the sample collection. The Standards for Parentage Testing Laboratories published by the AABB state: \"all biologic samples for testing shall be collected by persons with no interest in the test outcome\" [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/3\">",

"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    the tested person's photograph can be taken at the time of sample collection. Since government photo identifications do not always reflect the most recent and accurate appearance of the tested individual, identity is best documented with a photocopy of government photographic identification accompanied by the tested individual's photograph taken at the time of sample collection.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Each collected sample must be clearly identified through an affixed label containing a unique identification for the collected sample, the date of collection, and initials of the person collecting the sample. The person who provides legal consent for the collection of the sample must verify the accuracy of the affixed label in writing [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Strict chain-of-custody procedures also apply. Samples may never be left out of sight. They must be sealed in a tamper-evident package immediately following sample collection. Test participants may not package or transfer the samples to the testing laboratory.",

"     Prenatal testing",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A request from a pregnant woman to determine the identity of the father of her fetus is becoming a more common event. Some women may use the test to terminate pregnancies that have arisen from a sexual assault or from an extramarital relationship. Others may use the information in legal proceedings, such as custody, child support, and inheritance rights.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Whatever the motivation for requesting prenatal paternity testing, an obstetrician is under no obligation to perform or become involved in such testing if it violates his or her moral, ethical, religious, or professional beliefs. The obstetrician can notify the patient that",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     he/she",

"    does not participate in prenatal paternity testing and refer her to another physician who may be able to assist her.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    To perform prenatal paternity testing, biologic samples from the mother, fetus (by amniocentesis or CVS), and at least one suspected father are required. Testing may only be performed if a court order or informed consent of all adults involved has been obtained. The principle of autonomy and the confidentiality established by the doctor-patient relationship mandate that there is no obligation to inform the patient's partner (or husband) that paternity is an issue in the pregnancy.",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This test can be done as early as 9 weeks of gestation, requires only a blood sample from the pregnant mother and alleged father(s), and costs $1625 in the United States. Cell-free fetal DNA isolated from the plasma of the mother&rsquo;s blood is analyzed using a dense microarray chip that examines 317,000 genetic markers known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An informatics algorithm is used to compute the similarity of genetic markers between the fetal DNA and the alleged father&rsquo;s DNA, as well as to unrelated random individuals. Although the methodology appears sound, results of peer reviewed clinical trials are not available, and there are no AABB professional guidelines for the use of such parentage testing, methodology standards, and proficiency testing. We do not endorse the use of such tests prior to comprehensive scientific and medical review [",

"     PATERNITY TESTING",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Although the extent of misattributed paternity is unknown, estimates are surprisingly high and generally range from 5 to 20 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A series reported by the AABB and including over 300,000 tests found that the average paternity exclusion rate for laboratories reporting exclusions was 27.4 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/9\">",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    DNA parentage testing typically analyzes nuclear DNA. Although each individual has a unique sequence of nuclear DNA (except identical twins), more than 99.9 percent of the information present in the human genome is shared by unrelated individuals. Parentage testing using DNA analysis identifies variable regions of DNA (DNA polymorphisms) in the remaining 0.1 percent of our genetic material and then compares these sequences for different individuals.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     DNA length polymorphisms",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;One of the most useful types of polymorphic DNAs in parentage testing is length polymorphism. Length polymorphisms occur when small sections of DNA sequences are repeated numerous times in a row at a specific locus. The number of times these tandem DNA units are repeated produce alleles that are shorter in some people and longer in others. Two fragment lengths can be identified in each individual at the specified locus, one from each chromosome of the pair.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These tandemly repeated regions of DNA are typically classified into several groups depending on the size of the repeat region. Minisatellites (also called \"variable number of tandem repeats\" [VNTRs]) have core repeats with 9 to 80 base pairs, while microsatellites (also called \"short tandem repeats\" [STRs]) contain 2 to 5 base pair repeats. Paternity testing laboratories have moved primarily towards the analyses of tetranucleotide STRs, which may be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Millions of copies of DNA fragments of interest are rapidly produced using this technology. These PCR-generated fragments are then sorted by size through electrophoresis and the specific fragment lengths are identified.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    At any specified genetic locus, two fragment lengths can be identified in each individual, one from each chromosome of a homologous pair. When reading DNA test results, it is important to first compare the allele sizes of the child and mother. One of the alleles in the child must match one of the alleles in the mother since the child must have received one-half of its DNA from the mother. The child's remaining allele can only have been inherited from the biological father and it is called the \"obligate paternal allele.\"",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Paternity index",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The paternity index (PI) is the ratio of the chance that the alleged father will pass a marker gene to the child compared to the chance that a random man will pass the marker gene to the child. The frequency of distribution of individual marker genes for a randomly selected man is determined from a database.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    If the tested man does not have the child's obligate paternal allele, the observed pattern is inconsistent with paternity (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70179 \" href=\"UTD.htm?29/46/30444\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). The observed inconsistency at the specified locus is documented by a PI of zero (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82594 \" href=\"UTD.htm?26/52/27468\">",
"     table 2",
"    </a>",
"    ). An opinion of nonpaternity should not be rendered on the basis of a genetic mismatch at a single DNA site, or even when the mismatch involves two sites, especially when all remaining tested systems yield a large combined paternity index (discussed below). Most such occurrences merely reflect de novo genetic mutations that occur naturally in normal people. In cases where there are only one or two mismatches, the PI value at a single or double mismatching genetic site is not documented as zero, but calculated using equations that incorporate the mutation rate at the specified genetic site. For typical DNA-RFLP and -STR systems, average mutation rates range from 0.005 to 1 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29736/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    DNA family relationship testing laboratories usually require that a minimum of three genetic mismatches between the alleged father and the child be present prior to rendering the diagnosis of nonpaternity, as three or more de novo mutations would be exceedingly rare (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82594 \" href=\"UTD.htm?26/52/27468\">",
"     table 2",
"    </a>",
"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    When a genetic match is identified between the tested man and a child, a PI is calculated to determine the likelihood of a coincidental match (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77866 \" href=\"UTD.htm?36/52/37708\">",
"     table 3",
"    </a>",
"    ). The PI utilizes information on the frequency of any one particular allele in the general population. When the paternal allele seen in the child is abundant in the population at large, a coincidental match (or a match by chance) is not unusual so the PI is low.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Combined paternity index (CPI)",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The final analysis combines all of the genetic evidence and is a product of all of the individual PI values for both mismatches and matches. This is the bottom-line result of the DNA paternity test and it is called the Combined Paternity Index (CPI). The CPI is a ratio of the chance that the tested man, given his entire analyzed genetic makeup, is the biological father compared to the chance that a random man is the biological father.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    At what percent of probability does one feel reasonably secure in concluding that the tested man is the child's biological father? Currently, a CPI of 100 is the minimum required to establish parentage for legal purposes in most states. What does this level of test result really mean?",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A CPI of 100 means that the tested man is 100 times more likely to be the biological father than a random man in the general population. For a CPI of 100, the Random Man Not Excluded (RMNE) statistic value would also equal approximately 100 and it would be expressed as \"one individual in 100 has the same genetic pattern as the tested man,\" and the probability of paternity that the tested man is the biological father would be 99 percent. At this level, which is the minimum legal standard, 1 out of approximately 100 individuals in the population has the same genetic pattern as the tested man, and therefore could be the biological father.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A number of laboratories believe that the minimum CPI required for legal establishment of parentage should be raised from a CPI of 100 (probability of paternity 99 percent) to a CPI of 1000 (probability of paternity 99.9 percent) to determine the biological father with a reasonable degree of certainty and to decrease the rate of false positive paternity results (",

"     <li>",
"      A case reported at the Twelfth International Symposium on Human Identification involved a man accused of sexual assault whose DNA paternity test result showed a 99.3 percent probability of paternity [",

"    A CPI of 1000 (probability of paternity &ge;99.9 percent) is possible in virtually all cases when the child, the child's mother, and the alleged father are tested at 13 independent genetic sites that include the CODIS loci. If testing is limited to samples collected from only the child and the alleged father (the mother's sample is not tested), a CPI of 1000 is not reached in up to 10 percent of cases. The need to collect and test the mother's sample in these cases to reach a CPI of 1000 increases testing costs. If the mother is absolutely unavailable for testing, the laboratory would be required to test several additional genetic sites between the child and the alleged father before a CPI of 1000 could be reached in most cases, which also increases testing costs.",

DNA paternity tests cannot distinguish the true biological father in cases where two alleged fathers are monozygotic twins because monozygotic twins have identical nuclear DNA. When two alleged fathers are related as full siblings, they share half of their genetic makeup. In such cases, the most conclusive DNA paternity test results are obtained when both alleged fathers undergo DNA paternity testing: the DNA testing laboratory continues testing until one of these alleged fathers shows at least three genetic mismatches with the tested child.",

"    Sometimes the two alleged fathers are related as brothers and only one alleged father is available for DNA testing. In such cases, the DNA testing laboratory typically performs extended DNA testing analyzing a minimum of 15 to 24 genetic sites and the child's mother's sample is also tested (unless her sample is unavailable). Such extended testing and testing of the child's mother allow DNA testing laboratories to exclude a falsely accused brother from paternity in most cases; however, absolute certainty of exclusion in such cases can only be achieved when both brothers are tested.",

This presumption is only valid when the tested paternal grandparents are true biological parents of the deceased alleged father of the child.",

"    If the alleged paternal grandparents' alleles match the alleles of the child, the probability of grandparentage is determined. The calculations for the probability of grandparentage are based on gene frequencies of the matching alleles. The DNA test for grandparentage has the ability to reach probabilities of grandparentage far in excess of 99.9 percent. However, there are some limitations to this testing. As an example, the DNA test for grandparentage cannot resolve paternity if two potential fathers are related as full brothers, and therefore, have the same parents.",

"    If only one alleged grandparent is available, testing is problematic. As a couple, the two paternal grandparents collectively match the child on one half of the child's genes, while a single grandparent only matches 25 percent of the child's genes. Therefore, when only one alleged grandparent is tested with the child, it is impossible for the testing laboratory to conclusively prove that the tested alleged grandparent is not the child's grandparent.

The woman who gave birth to the child was the child's mother. In large measure, paternity has been based on social, rather than biological factors. Widespread availability of highly accurate DNA tests raises questions about whether genetic parentage testing should replace social and childrearing tests for parenthood. In some states, statutes have been passed that allow a genetic test to upset paternity judgments at any time in the child's life. Legal initiatives have been proposed to allow a man to stop paying child support if a DNA paternity test shows he is not the father [",

In fact, assisted reproduction techniques create situations where a child may have several \"parents,\" such as an egg donor, sperm donor, gestational carrier, and the couple who intend to raise the child. Clearly, we need to reanalyze our definition of parentage.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The process of parentage determination also raises a number of other issues. There are questions about who should be able to order DNA parentage testing, and under what circumstances. Should an individual be able to use a hair follicle from a comb, or collect a buccal swab from a minor child and test the child's DNA without their custodian's knowledge or consent? Should presumed fathers be allowed to surreptitiously test children without maternal consent? Should divorced fathers and lovers use DNA testing to reopen previously agreed-upon child support responsibilities?",

"    Genetic testing has the potential to be highly disruptive to families, and to children who may find themselves cut off financially and emotionally from the persons they consider parents.

A combined paternity index of 1000 should be utilized as a minimum requirement to establish paternity. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Paternity index'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The Random Man Not Excluded (RMNE) statistic closely approximates the CPI. For a CPI of 1000, the RMNE statistic value would also equal approximately 1000 and it would be expressed as \"one individual in 1000 has the same genetic pattern\" as the tested man. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H14\">",
"       'Random man not excluded'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The Y-STR paternal lineage DNA test can be used to determine whether two or more males are related through their paternal lineage. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H21\">",
"       'Y-STR DNA test'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      An opinion of non-paternity should not be rendered on the basis of a genetic mismatch at a single DNA site. A minimum of three genetic mismatches between the alleged father and the child should be present prior to rendering the diagnosis of non-paternity. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Paternity index'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Prenatal paternity testing requires informed consent from all adults involved in testing, samples from the mother, one of the potential fathers, and the fetus (by either CVS or amniocentesis). In other situations, legal standards for consent may not exist, but experts believe parentage testing without consent or court order is unethical. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H8\">",
"       'Prenatal testing'",
"      </a>",
"      above and",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H24\">",
"       'Ethical considerations'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Regulation of DNA parentage laboratories is voluntary. The AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) is the primary organization that has established national standards for DNA parentage testing and performs on site laboratory inspections. Parentage testing should only be performed by accredited laboratories and all testing should be done in accordance with accreditation standards. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H23\">",
"       'Finding an accredited testing facility'",
"      </a>",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hypertension is the most prevalent major risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), being more common than cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, the other major risk factors. In the INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries, hypertension accounted for 18 percent of the population-attributable risk of a first myocardial infarction (MI) [",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The impact of hypertension on the risk of the development of a cardiovascular event such as myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death is directly related to the level of blood pressure. In addition, the majority of individuals with hypertension have one or more other risk factors [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29737/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The excess risk of a future cardiovascular event attributable to hypertension is greater in individuals with established CVD, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease compared to those at lower risk. The 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) report on high blood pressure cited ischemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cerebrovascular disease as \"compelling indications\" for the treatment of hypertension [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29737/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Other considerations include peripheral artery disease and traditional major coronary risk factors such as cigarette smoking and family history (",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    For those patients in whom a decision is made to lower blood pressure, the two most important issues are the choice of antihypertensive agent(s) and the goal blood pressure (BP). The goal BP in patients at increased risk for a cardiovascular event will be reviewed here. Goal BP in the general population and in the specific settings of diabetes, proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and heart failure are discussed separately. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The benefit of BP reduction in patients at increased risk of a cardiovascular event has been investigated in a number of major clinical trials. Some of these trials compared an ACE inhibitor or ARB to placebo, while other trials compared two or more antihypertensive agents, at least one of which was usually an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).",
"   </p>",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most important infections in renal transplant recipients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29738/abstract/1-5\">",
"     1-5",

"    ]. Exposure to the virus, as indicated by the presence of detectable IgG anti-CMV antibodies in the plasma, increases with age in the general population and is present in more than two-thirds of donors and recipients prior to transplantation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29738/abstract/1\">",
"     1",

"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    recipient to be CMV-positive at the time of transplantation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    CMV can be transmitted from the donor either by blood transfusion or by the transplanted kidney; the concurrent administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection further increases the risk of clinically relevant CMV disease, with induction therapy principally being associated with an increased risk of disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/2/29738/abstract/6,7\">",
"     6,7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, both the recipient and the donor are routinely tested for anti-CMV antibodies prior to transplantation. (See",

"      This was shown in a study using data from the US Renal Data System in which donor and recipient CMV sero-status was available for over 17,000 deceased donor renal transplant recipients [",

"       8",
"      </a>",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The impact of CMV on overall mortality was examined in a prospective, single center study of almost 500 patients who did not receive induction therapy or CMV prophylaxis [",

Compared to those without CMV, CMV disease was associated with a relative risk of overall mortality of 2.5, and importantly, asymptomatic CMV infection was associated with a relative risk of overall mortality of 2.9.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It should be noted that many deceased donors receive numerous blood transfusions before the retrieval of organs. Under such circumstances, it should be presumed that one or more of the units of blood were CMV positive and the recipient will require prophylaxis even if the donor and recipient are CMV negative serologically.",

"     CMV INFECTION VERSUS DISEASE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There is an important distinction between CMV infection and CMV disease. Detection of virus via culture, molecular techniques or changes in serology defines CMV infection. Infection is considered to be present if one or more of the following findings is noted: seroconversion with the appearance of anti-CMV IgM antibodies; a fourfold increase in preexisting anti-CMV IgG titers; detection of CMV antigens in infected cells; detection of CMV-DNAemia by molecular techniques;",

"    CMV disease, in comparison, requires clinical signs and symptoms, such as fever, leukopenia, or organ involvement (including hepatitis, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, colitis, meningoencephalitis, and rarely myocarditis) [",

"     1,2,10",

"    ]. CMV chorioretinitis, relatively common in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a rare feature of CMV disease in transplant recipients. However, progressive chorioretinitis, when it occurs, can become clinically apparent several months after transplantation, even in patients without previous evidence of symptomatic infection. (See",

Subsequently, preventive strategies have been developed that have significantly lowered the incidence of CMV disease, which is approximately five percent with modern approaches [",

We recommend viral monitoring with weekly CMV-PCRs for four weeks to make sure CMV has not reactivated on this lower dose. If CMV recurs, we discontinue the antimetabolite indefinitely, and re-treat the patient as above. If CMV reactivation does not occur we continue the antimetabolite at the reduced dose.",

"      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. CMV is present in more than two-thirds of donors and recipients prior to transplantation and can be transmitted from the donor by the transplanted kidney; the concurrent administration of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection increases the risk of clinically relevant CMV disease. Both the recipient and the donor are routinely tested for anti-CMV antibodies prior to transplantation. (See",

"     <li>",
"      The incidence of CMV disease in the transplant recipient may be lowered by either prophylactic or preventive strategies. A prophylactic strategy involves the administration of antiviral agents to patients at increased risk of developing CMV infection. A preemptive strategy involves periodic monitoring for viremia to permit prompt treatment after the detection of early systemic infection. It is unclear which preventive strategy is more effective. The preemptive approach requires extreme vigilance. (See",
