"      The following is a list of questions that everyone should ask if they are told they need a procedure (such as endoscopy or heart catheterization) or surgery.",
"     </p>",

"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       Why do I need the procedure or surgery?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;It sounds like a silly question, but people often don&rsquo;t know why their doctor has recommended a procedure or surgery. More important, doctors sometimes offer procedures or surgery to people who might benefit from them but who could instead be treated with other options. Some related questions that are also worth asking are:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Are there options besides the procedure or surgery?",
"        </strong>",
"        &ndash; In some cases, the procedure or surgery is one of several treatment options. If you have a choice of treatments, and the procedure or surgery is just one option, you will have to decide&mdash;with input from your doctor&mdash;what to do. People decide whether to have procedures or surgery based on:",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"hyphen-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        How much their problem bothers them",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        How likely the procedure or surgery is to help",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        How worried they are about the risks involved",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Whether they have someone at home who can help take care of them afterwards",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        How long the recovery period might be",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Whether the procedure or surgery will relieve pain they currently have",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        How much pain the procedure or surgery might cause",
"       </li>",

"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         What if I don't have the procedure or surgery?",
"        </strong>",
"        &ndash; Some conditions that are treated with procedures or surgery get worse without treatment; some get better; and some stay the same. If the procedure or surgery is not absolutely necessary and your symptoms don&rsquo;t bother you too much, you might decide to have other treatments.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        <strong>",
"         Is there more than one procedure or surgery that accomplishes the same goal?",
"        </strong>",
"        &ndash; Sometimes a condition can be treated in more than one way. Ask your doctor what options you have and what the differences are between them. Below are examples of some of the main surgery and procedure options. &nbsp;",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"hyphen-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        Open surgery &ndash; For open surgery, the surgeon makes a cut big enough that he or she can work on your body directly from the outside.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Minimally invasive surgery &ndash; For minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon makes smaller cuts and uses special tools that go inside your body and can be controlled from the outside.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Percutaneous procedures &ndash; For percutaneous procedures, the doctor gets access to a part of the body, such as the heart, through a blood vessel. He or she inserts a special tool into the blood vessel and advances the tool&mdash;within the blood vessel&mdash;to the area with the problem.",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Endoscopic procedures &ndash; For endoscopic procedures, the doctor uses a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end. The tube can go into the natural openings in the body (such as the mouth or vagina) to look at or treat conditions of the stomach or intestines (gastrointestinal endoscopy), bladder (cystoscopy) or uterus (hysteroscopy).",

"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What are the benefits and risks of the procedure or surgery?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Every procedure or surgery, no matter how &ldquo;minor,&rdquo; carries risks. Make sure you understand what you stand to gain from the procedure or surgery and what you stand to lose.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Here are some related questions to ask:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        What are the chances that I will benefit and how long is the benefit likely to last?",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        What are the most common risks, and how long do their effects last?",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        What are the most serious risks, even if they are not very common?",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428822\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What if I want a second opinion?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Do not be afraid to ask for a second opinion, if you would like one. No doctor should ever be worried or bothered if you want a second opinion. In fact, your doctor should be willing to help you find the best surgeon to suit your needs.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      You can also get the names of other doctors who perform the procedure or surgery from your primary care doctor or from people you know who have had similar procedures or surgeries.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428837\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What type of anesthesia will I need and what risks does it have?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Some of the risks of a procedure or surgery come from the type of anesthesia that is used. Even &ldquo;minor&rdquo; surgeries have risks related to anesthesia.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428852\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       What will my recovery be like?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;People do not always know what to expect in the recovery period after a procedure or surgery. It&rsquo;s very important to find out&mdash;ahead of time&mdash;the answers to these questions:",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"       <li>",
"        How much pain can I expect in the days and weeks afterward?",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        How will my pain be treated or managed? &nbsp;",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        How long will I be in the hospital?",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Will I need help when I return home?",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        Will I need to have someone drive me home after the procedure? &nbsp;",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        After the procedure or surgery, will I be able drive, work, go up and down stairs, and do all the things I normally do? If not, how long will I be unable to do these things? &nbsp;",
"       </li>",
"       <li>",
"        When will I be able to return to work?",
"       </li>",
"      </ul>",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428867\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       How much experience does my surgeon have?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ask your surgeon, &ldquo;How many of these procedures or surgeries have you done in the last year?&rdquo; Find out, too, if the hospital where you will have the procedure or surgery has a lot of experience handling people having the procedure or surgery you need. You want a doctor and hospital with a lot of experience.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      For some types of surgery, it&rsquo;s best to go to a place that specializes in the type of procedure or surgery you need. For example, weight loss surgery is best done at a &ldquo;center of excellence&rdquo; that is dedicated to this type of surgery. That&rsquo;s because people having weight loss surgery often need to be seen by a lot of different healthcare providers with a special interest in obesity. Plus, people who need weight loss surgery often have special needs because of their size.",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Before you have your procedure or surgery, ask if there are doctors or treatment centers that specialize in the type of procedure or surgery you need. If so, ask how your doctor&rsquo;s experience compares with that of the doctors there. You might decide to try to get treated at the specialty center, or you might not. But knowing how your options compare will help you make the decision that&rsquo;s right for you.",
"     </p>",
"     <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23428884\">",
"      <span class=\"h1\">",
"       How much will the procedure or surgery cost?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Even with insurance coverage, people often have to pay some costs themselves when they have a procedure or surgery. It&rsquo;s a good idea to find out ahead of time what you might have to pay. For that information, call your insurance company directly. When you speak with them, ask if they have to &ldquo;pre-approve&rdquo; your procedure or surgery. If cost is a concern for you, ask your insurance provider and your doctor whether there are less expensive treatment options that could help you.",

"     Association with environmental allergies",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The evidence that environmental allergies are involved in EoE is more controversial than food allergies. The diagnosis of EoE has been shown to occur in seasonal pattern, with peaks of new diagnosis occurring at the height of the aeroallergen season and a decrease in newly diagnosed patients in the winter, in both children and adults [",

"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Consistent with this result, duodenal eosinophilia, mucosal IgE+ cells, and T cells were found on biopsies during the peak of birch pollen season, but not out of season, in birch-sensitive patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30534/abstract/11\">",
"     11",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    One patient was reported whose EoE was solely dependent on environmental allergies, with up to 40 eosinophils per high power field in the esophagus that resolved out of pollen season [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The purpose of allergy testing for foods in patients with EoE is to help determine which foods to remove for the elimination diet and in which order to try to reintroduce the eliminated foods. In addition, testing for IgE-mediated food allergies may identify patients who are also at risk for acute allergic reactions to foods (eg, urticaria, anaphylaxis) in addition to EoE. This is particularly a concern when eliminated foods are reintroduced into the diet during treatment. However, the clinical utility of food allergen testing for identification of EoE triggers remains largely unknown, with data concerning sensitivity and specificity derived thus far from few centers, primarily managing children. Limited data in adolescents and adults suggests that the value of food allergy testing in EoE appears to decline with increasing age. In addition, allergy testing for foods is not solely sufficient to diagnose food triggers (response to diet and results from biopsies are needed to confirm the relationship).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There are three main methods for testing food allergies in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): skin prick testing (SPT), in vitro specific IgE testing, and atopy patch testing (APT). SPT and in vitro testing are used to identify IgE-mediated allergies and APT is used to identify non-IgE mediated allergies.",

"    <strong>",
"     not",
"    </strong>",
"    a trigger if the negative predictive value (NPV) for that food-specific test is high. Similarly, a food that tests positive is most likely a trigger if the positive predictive value (PPV) for that food-specific test is high. Predictive values are affected by disease prevalence. APT appears to have better negative predictive values (NPVs) than SPT (ie, the foods that test negative are probably not triggers), but positive predictive values (PPVs) are typically better with SPT than APT (ie, the foods that test positive may be triggers). Combining APT and SPT results improves NPV, but worsens PPV. We perform both SPT and APT for the initial food allergy evaluation in patients with EoE. (See",

"     27-29",

The negative predictive value (NPV) on isolated skin testing was generally high, with a rate of greater than 90 percent for less common foods (potato, chicken, peanut, beef, pork, and corn) and 79 to 90 percent for egg, wheat, and soy. However the NPV was less than 30 percent for milk. The positive predictive values were poor, ranging from 26 to 62 percent, with milk being the exception at 86 percent.",
"   </p>",

"    In a series of 20 adults who had success with the six food (empiric) elimination diet, food triggers were identified in all patients upon reintroduction [",

"     30",
"    </a>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30534/abstract/31\">",
"     31",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30534/abstract/33\">",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Atopy patch testing",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The use of atopy patch testing (APT) was initially explored for the diagnosis of food allergies in patients with atopic dermatitis, and subsequently studied in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. A general discussion of APT and its use in atopic dermatitis are reviewed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/21/10585?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H12#H12\">",
"     \"Future diagnostic tools for food allergy\", section on 'Atopy patch testing'",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Atopy patch testing involves the application of fresh food or rehydrated food in an occlusive Finn chamber for 48 hours on a patient&rsquo;s back. The Finn chamber is then removed and a reading of the reactions is done immediately after removal and 24 hours later. Reactions are read using a consensus scale from the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis that is based upon the findings of induration, erythema, and papules [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30534/abstract/34\">",
"     34",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This scale is different than the scale used in contact dermatitis, which only examines induration. The main limitation in atopy patch testing is the lack of standardized reagents. In addition, the studies of APT were primarily performed in patients with known disease and, therefore, the test may not have the same predictive values for identifying food allergies in the general public. Additional issues include operator dependence, need to keep the allergens on the skin for 48 hours, and the requirement for multiple visits to have the tests placed, removed, and read.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The predictive values for APT in EoE were determined for causal foods identified after normalization of biopsies following removal of single foods or reintroduction of a food leading to an increase in eosinophils (&gt;15 per high power field) on esophageal biopsies performed at one center [",

"     27-29,35",

"    ]. The predictive values for the most common causal foods were calculated in a sequential fashion, with each patient first undergoing skin prick testing (SPT) and then APT. Patients did not have APT to foods that were positive on SPT. The negative predictive values (NPV) for APT were better than for SPT, with values &gt;90 percent for egg, soy, peanut, beef, corn, chicken, potato, and pork and 87 percent for wheat. However, the NPV remained low for milk at 31 percent. The positive predictive values (PPV) were poor for most foods (12 to 51 percent), except for milk at 86 percent and egg at 61 percent in a cohort of 319 children [",

"     36",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, the two groups used different testing materials and reading scales for a positive APT value (one designed for use in food allergy and the other for contact dermatitis), making it difficult to compare the study results. A lower rate of positive APT in older children compared with younger children suggests a limited value in older children and adults [",

In children with a diagnosis of EoE, our approach to allergy testing is:",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      We first skin prick test to the top ten foods (milk, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, beef, corn, chicken, potato, and pork) and the other major foods in the patient&rsquo;s diet (limiting to less than 30 foods).",

"      Next we perform atopy patch testing to the foods that were negative on skin prick testing.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",

"      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the esophagus. Most patients with EoE have underlying atopic conditions, and food allergies play a major role in the pathogenesis of EoE. (See",

"      The primary methods of food allergy testing used for patients with EoE are skin prick testing (SPT) and atopy patch testing (APT). In general, these tests have good negative predictive values and poor positive predictive values, with the exception of milk. (See",

"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;One of the most common causes of acquired hemolytic anemia is immunologic destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) mediated by autoantibodies directed against antigens on the patient's RBCs. The clinical manifestations of this group of diseases, called autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), depend greatly upon the type of antibody that is produced by the abnormal immune reaction.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic will review the mechanisms underlying AIHA due to cold agglutinins. The clinical features and treatment of this disorder and issues related to another form of cold-related hemolysis, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, are discussed separately. (See",

"     NATURE OF THE AUTOANTIBODIES",

"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      IgM antibodies that generally react with polysaccharide antigens on the RBC surface only at temperatures below that of the core temperature of the body. They are therefore called \"",

"      <strong>",
"       warm",
"      </strong>",
"      agglutinins\" even though they seldom directly agglutinate the RBCs. Rarely, IgM antibodies have these reaction characteristics and readily agglutinate red cells. (See",

"     Antibody detection: the direct Coombs' test",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are usually diagnosed by demonstrating an abnormality in a single clinical laboratory test, the direct antiglobulin test first described by Coombs and therefore sometimes called the direct Coombs' test. In this test, the RBCs of the patient are washed free of adherent proteins and reacted with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies prepared against the various immunoglobulins, particularly IgG and a fragment of the third component of complement, C3d. If either or both of these are present on the red cell surface, agglutination or some other endpoint will be detected (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69817 \" href=\"UTD.htm?38/6/39020\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The IgM antibody of cold agglutinin disease and the IgG Donath-Landsteiner antibody in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria both show better fixation to the RBC surface at lower temperature. However, when these samples are warmed, the IgM antibody, which was only loosely bound, elutes from the surface, leaving only the attached complement sequences. A more complete discussion of the direct Coombs' test can be found elsewhere (see",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?20/2/20521?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Warm agglutinins and drugs\"",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     COLD AGGLUTININ DISEASE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;It was recognized very early that some red cell antigen-antibody interactions resulting in immune hemolysis occurred more readily or more strongly when the temperature was reduced. As an example, the agglutination induced by the major blood group antibodies (ie, naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B) is greater at 4&ordm;C than at room temperature. Antibodies were subsequently found in the serum of patients with hemolytic anemia that did not appear to interact with red cells at body temperature but reacted strongly at lower temperatures; these antibodies were called \"cold agglutinins\" [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/5,6\">",
"     5,6",

"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     The antibodies",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;As mentioned above, cold agglutinins are nearly always IgM antibodies. IgM antibodies have two antigen-binding sites sufficiently far apart to bridge the distance imposed upon red cells in suspension by physical forces (eg, charge, zeta potential) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, a single IgM molecule can bind two red cells together; if this occurs in a lattice-like network, agglutination results. Thus, very small concentrations of these antibodies, perhaps as few as 25 molecules per cell [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ], can be readily detected in vitro.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The specificity of the cold agglutinins is designated by their reactivity with adult and fetal red cells, both untreated and treated with specific enzymes. These antigens are present on all cells in varying concentrations, in contrast to many blood group antigens. The most common cold agglutinins are designated anti-I; they react best with untreated adult red cells (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61974 \" href=\"UTD.htm?25/58/26540\">",
"     table 2",
"    </a>",
"    ). Others, which react best with fetal or cord red cells, are called anti-i. Much less common are antibodies reacting with cells treated with proteases (anti-Pr) or with sialidase; the details of these specificities are given below. (See",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"     'The antigens'",
"    </a>",
"    below.)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Cold agglutinins are very restricted in their structure. Anti-I antibodies are more likely to be composed of kappa than lambda light chains. The components of the heavy chain are derived from a restricted set of variable domains. Out of about 100 possible V(H) genes available, nearly all antibodies of I, i, or j (I and i) specificity use a single V(H) gene, V(H)4-34 (formerly called V(H)4-21) in the primary assembly of the heavy chain [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/9-12\">",
"     9-12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This produces a cross-reactive idiotype in all of these antibodies which can be detected by the monoclonal antibody, 9G4 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/10,12,13\">",
"     10,12,13",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The importance of 9G4 in cold anti-I and anti-i activity can be illustrated by the following observation. Many IgM antibodies specific for Rh antigens (59 percent in one series) are 9G4 positive [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. At 4&ordm;C, 16 and 44 percent of the 9G4-positive antibodies agglutinated I and i cells, respectively, compared with none of 9G4-negative antibodies. The epitope for the monoclonal antibody 9G4 is expressed on the heavy chain FR1 whereas the specificity for Rh epitopes (D) is generated by the light chains and CDRH3.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A hydrophobic patch in FR-1 is required for the antibody to bind the I antigen [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Three-dimensional structure of the Fab of a human monoclonal IgM cold agglutinin with anti-I activity was determined and shows an extended cavity with an adjacent pocket, consistent with one that binds a polysaccharide [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/16\">",
"     16",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Since these parts of the molecule take part in forming the antigen binding site, this explains how both specificities may be expressed. Whether they work together for greater interaction with the red cell is not clear.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The V(H)4-34 variable region is also used in other IgM antibodies, including other autoantibodies, [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/17\">",
"     17",
"    </a>",
"    ], anti-DNA antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/18\">",
"     18",
"    </a>",
"    ], and antibodies against endotoxin [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/19\">",
"     19",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Cold agglutinins are relatively ineffective in bringing about hemolysis of the red cell. Since phagocytic or other cytotoxic cells of the immune system do not have receptors for IgM, all of the destruction that is seen is due to the fixation of complement. Normal red cells have surface proteins that protect them from the effects of complement (CD55 and CD59); thus, large numbers of complement-activation units must be fixed onto the RBC surface for lysis of the cell to occur. These units can only be generated when the blood circulates to the colder parts of the body (eg digits, ears, nose). The temperature at these sites must be low enough to allow the interaction between cell and antibody to occur.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The amount of hemolysis depends upon several factors, which explain the variability in the degree of hemolysis among patients with cold agglutinin disease [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30535/abstract/20\">",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The amount of antibody in the plasma. This is usually measured as the highest dilution of serum that will still agglutinate red cells in a 1 percent suspension. The titer varies greatly from patient to patient, ranging as high as 1:50,000 or more. All other things being equal, the higher the titer, the more hemolysis that occurs.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The highest temperature at which the antibody reacts with antigen, which is also called the thermal amplitude. Most cold agglutinin antibodies react very poorly at room temperature and not at all at body temperature. If, however, they do react at temperatures near body temperature, the likelihood that this temperature will be achieved in the peripheral parts of the body is increased and hemolysis will be more likely.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The degree to which antibody fixation is inhibited by the presence of C3d on the red cell surface. Since this fragment of complement is present on circulating cells, it inhibits the ability of some antibodies to generate further complement-initiating complexes, thereby reducing hemolysis. Those antibodies that are not so inhibited are more effective in lysing the circulating cells.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Some cold agglutinins affix to the red cells but do not fix complement. These antibodies are frequently cryoprecipitable. Thus, patients with such an antibody may have severe clinical agglutination (acrocyanosis, pain on swallowing cold fluids) but no hemolysis and no anemia.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The specificity of the antibody may determine to a small degree its ability to lyse red cells. Adult red cells have a reduced concentration of the unbranched (i) antigen (see below) and hence are less susceptible to lysis by antibodies with anti-i specificity.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     The antigens",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The antigenic epitopes with which cold agglutinins react are invariably polysaccharide in structure. The reaction between the protein antibody and the sugars is largely through weaker bonds (eg, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces) rather than through more stable interactions (eg, ionic). This weak reaction may be due to the nature of both the antigen and the antigen binding site on the antibody, which is very restricted in its chemistry. These weak forces are made more effective by reduction in ambient temperature, which has the effect of reducing spontaneous Brownian movement, accounting for the cold-reactivity.",

"    The antigens reacting with cold agglutinins are present on",
"    <strong>",

"      Anti-i antibodies react more strongly with cord blood red cells or the cells of rare adults who are designated \"genetic-i\".",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The chemical structures with which these antibodies react are related complex polysaccharides, which may be attached to ceramide or to protein structures. The i antigen consists of a straight-chain polymer of aminyllactose disaccharides. It is the predominant structure on the red cells during fetal life. At birth, an enzyme is activated that is able to add aminyllactose disaccharides to the sixth carbon of galactose, resulting in branched molecules; this branched structure is the I antigen.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These complex polysaccharides serve as precursor substances for the formation of the ABH and Lewis blood group antigens. Sometimes, the epitope of particular anti-I or anti-i antibodies may include parts of those antigens. The specificity of such antibodies is designated anti-IA, anti-IB, etc. Rare antibodies react equally well with the I and the i structure; these antibodies are designated \"anti-j\".",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The vast majority of cold agglutinins are either anti-I or anti-i. However, other specificities have been identified by determining whether the expression of the antigen is altered by treatment of the test red blood cells with proteolytic enzymes",

"     23",
"    </a>",
"    ]; fine distinctions are made among them on other bases. Those that are dependent upon sialic acid (which may be added to the end of the complex polysaccharide structures) are designated \"Sia\" followed by an \"l\" if on the linear (i-like structure), a \"b\" if on the branched (I-like structure), or both if on both structures. As an example, Sia-l would designate a sialic acid-dependent structure on the linear polysaccharide. These sialic-acid dependent antibodies are rare.",

"    Less commonly, cold agglutinins are associated with other viral diseases. One bacterial infection, a particular strain of Listeria monocytogenes, may also cause the production of anti-I antibodies because of shared epitopes on its surface.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In most cases of postinfectious cold agglutinin production, the titer of antibody is quite low and little hemolysis is seen. The peak titer usually occurs two to three weeks after the onset of the infection and the last traces of antibody usually disappear in two to three months. If hemolysis occurs, it is unlikely to last more than two to four weeks. The antibody that is produced is oligoclonal; the light chain is primarily but not exclusively kappa and the heavy chain almost always uses the V(H)4 gene so that the antibodies exhibit the epitope reacting with 9G4 (see",

"   </p>",

"     27-31",

Among patients with lymphoid malignancy, those with the most benign proliferation (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma) may have specificity for the I antigen whereas the more malignant forms are more likely to have specificity for the i antigen. There are exceptions to this rule but the finding of an anti-i antibody in the absence of viral disease is usually a clear indication that the patient is harboring a lymphoma.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In 5 to 10 percent of patients who present with chronic cold agglutinin syndrome, a malignant clone arises that expresses the cold agglutinin. This may be heralded by an increasing titer of the antibody, even before the other manifestations of the disease (eg, enlarged lymph nodes, circulating malignant lymphocytes) may be manifest. The presence of trisomy 3 on chromosomal analysis of the lymphocytes may predict for this transformation [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The phagocytic and other destructive cells of the immune system do not have receptors for IgM as they do for IgG and IgA. Thus, since cold agglutinins are usually IgM, destruction of RBCs is primarily complement-mediated, occurring either by direct destruction of the membrane (direct lysis) or immunoadherence mediated by target-bound components (indirect lysis) [",

"     38",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In the case of most cold agglutinins, this can occur only when the blood circulates to the peripheral areas where the temperature of the blood is sufficiently low to bind antibody. When the blood returns to the central core of the body, the antibody may leave the antigen without complement being fixed. The higher the \"thermal amplitude\" of the antibody, the greater likelihood that the requisite temperature (for both antibody and complement fixation) will be reached [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The activation of complement results in the covalent binding of C4 and C3 to the red cell membrane. Both of these components are necessary for the further activation of complement but also are targets of receptors mediating immunoadherence. Immunoadherence can result in phagocytosis but the destructive process is very inefficient. Another limiting factor is that enzymes in the plasma and molecules on the cell and in the plasma inhibit and inactivate bound C3 and C4 very rapidly, reducing it to a covalently-bound nubbin (C3d).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Red cell destruction by this mechanism occurs in phagocytes, leading to progressive membrane loss, spherocyte formation, and splenic destruction, and leads primarily to signs of extravascular hemolysis, including increased serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect reacting bilirubin [",

"    The direct lytic action of complement is brought about by assembling polymers of the last component, C9 (called the membrane attack complex), in the membrane. If sufficient polymers are produced, the membrane becomes leaky and the cell is doomed. In this situation the patient may have signs of intravascular hemolysis, with the presence of hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and hemosiderinuria. This process is inefficient in normal red cells because of the presence of inhibitory molecules. Complement must be enormously activated in order for such lysis to occur, since many of the initiated or amplified sequences will be unsuccessful. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hypogonadism in a man refers to a decrease in one or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production. These abnormalities usually result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). In occasional cases, however, a defect in the ability to respond to testosterone is the cause of hypogonadism. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?16/44/17096?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the androgen receptor\"",

"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The distinction between primary and secondary hypogonadism is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The patient has primary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration and the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH and FSH concentrations are above normal.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The patient has secondary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration and the sperm count are subnormal and the serum LH and FSH concentrations are normal or reduced.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Primary hypogonadism differs from secondary hypogonadism in two ways:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with a decrease in sperm production than in testosterone production. Although many testicular diseases damage both the seminiferous tubules and the Leydig cells, they usually damage the seminiferous tubules to a greater degree. As a consequence, the sperm count may be low, and the serum FSH concentration normal or high, yet the serum testosterone concentration remains normal. In contrast, in secondary hypogonadism, there is a proportionate reduction in testosterone and sperm production.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably due to the stimulatory effect of the supranormal serum FSH and LH concentrations on testicular aromatase activity. This results in increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol and enhanced testicular secretion of estradiol relative to testosterone.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The major causes of primary hypogonadism in males will be reviewed here (",

"     table 1",

"    </strong>",
"    to an X chromosome.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The 47,XXY genotype results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes of either parent during meiotic division, while mosaicism probably results from nondisjunction during mitotic division after conception.

"     SUMMARY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hypogonadism in a male refers to a decrease in either of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production. These abnormalities usually result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism), disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism) or, more rarely, a defect in the ability to respond to testosterone.

"     <li>",
"      Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably due to the stimulatory effect of the supranormal serum FSH and LH concentrations on testicular aromatase activity.

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The common cold is a benign self-limited syndrome representing a group of diseases caused by members of several families of viruses. It is the most frequent acute illness in the United States and throughout the industrialized world [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30537/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The term \"common cold\" refers to a mild upper respiratory viral infection involving, to variable degrees, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sneezing, sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. The common cold is a separate and distinct entity, distinguishable from influenza, bacterial pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and pertussis.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The common cold is associated with an enormous economic burden as assessed by lost productivity and expenditures for treatment [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30537/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Data extrapolated from a United States telephone survey conducted between 2000 to 2001 suggest that about 500 million non-influenza viral respiratory infections occur yearly, resulting in estimated direct costs of $17 billion and indirect costs of $22.5 billion annually [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?29/52/30537/abstract/3\">",

"   <p>",
"    The average incidence of the common cold is five to seven episodes per year in preschool children, and two to three per year by adulthood. Annual absences due to colds from school and work in the United States caused 26 and 23 million lost days, respectively [",

"    Tens of millions of research dollars have been spent on ways to prevent and shorten the course of the common cold.

A second systematic review of 35 trials concluded that first-generation antihistamines had a small benefit for relief of rhinorrhea and sneezing, but that this clinical benefit was outweighed by the frequency of side effects; non-sedating antihistamines were not effective [",

Sixty-four colds occurred in participants who received a placebo compared to 24 in those who received a garlic supplement, and those receiving garlic supplements had fewer days of self-reported illness (111 versus 366). We agree with the authors of this meta-analysis that the limited evidence at this time is insufficient to conclude effectiveness for garlic and a larger randomized trial is needed.",

This study also found that the utility of preventive probiotic use for decreasing the mean duration of URI symptoms varied widely among trials, but that overall, no significant effect was demonstrated. The review found that probiotic use decreased the number of prescribed antibiotics, but the significance of this is unclear since antibiotics are not recommended for the treatment of viral upper respiratory infections. The conclusions of this review were limited by significant heterogeneity among included studies, by concerns related to blinding and concealment, by frequent failure to adequately differentiate between bacterial and viral etiologies, and by inclusion of infants and children but few older adults. Higher-quality, specific trials that include older adults are needed before concluding whether probiotics have a role in the prevention of respiratory tract infections in adults.",

A subsequent randomized trial, comparing no intervention with groups assigned to exercise (45 minutes daily at home plus 2.5 hours per week of group sessions) or mindfulness meditation found no statistically significant effect of exercise on the incidence of acute respiratory illness, severity of symptoms, or missed work days although there were trends toward a positive effect; meditation was associated with self-reported decreased global symptom severity and fewer missed days [",

"    Early studies examining the pharmacotherapy of depression in children and adolescents occurred in the 1960s. These early studies were inherently flawed in their design. The young participants were a mixed diagnostic group with heterogeneous symptoms; the measurements used to assess response were not consistent; and a mixed group of drugs were studied - from benzodiazepines to antidepressants. Nonetheless, these studies established that children and adolescents could safely tolerate psychopharmacologic agents if they were appropriately monitored. This information was necessary before double-blind trials of psychopharmacologic agents could be performed in children and adolescents, ushering in the TCA era.",

"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. TCAs also have effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and three distinct measures on the electrocardiogram: the PR interval, the QRS duration, and the corrected QT interval (QTc). The long-term clinical significance of these cardiac changes is not fully understood [",

In these patients, TCAs may be tried either instead of or in addition to SSRIs or another antidepressant [",

"    The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the action of the presynaptic serotonin reuptake pump, thereby increasing the amount of serotonin available in the synapse and increasing postsynaptic serotonin receptor occupancy. SSRIs have become the first-line therapy for depression because they are well tolerated, can be administered once a day, and have fewer adverse effects than TCAs [",

Untreated depression has the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. Every analysis of the use of antidepressants in pediatric patients since the black box warning was added has concluded that the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the potential risk of suicidality. Concerns about antidepressants and their potential side effects need to be balanced with the adverse effects and inherent risk of suicide associated with untreated depression. (See",

"    The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) plots sensitivity against 1- specificity (ie, the false positive rate). Cutoff values for the diagnostic test (such as serum ALT concentrations) vary along the length of the black curve, reflecting the interchange between sensitivity and specificity. The area under the ROC curve represents the accuracy of the test. A test that performs no better than chance would be represented by a straight line (red line) with an area under the ROC of 0.5. A near perfect test would have a rectangular configuration (blue line) with an area under the ROC approaching 1.00.",
