"     Several long-term or permanent methods of birth control are available. These are best for women who do not want to become pregnant in the near future (or ever). These methods work well, mostly because the woman does not have to remember anything on a regular basis.",

"     This article discusses long-term methods of birth control, including the intrauterine device (IUD), contraceptive implant, and sterilization. These are the most effective contraceptive methods available and, therefore, should be considered as first-line choices. Hormonal and barrier birth control methods are available separately. (See",

"     It can be difficult to decide which birth control method is best because of the variety of options available. The best method is one that you will use consistently and that does not cause bothersome side effects. Other factors to consider include:",

Most are made of molded plastic and have a string that you can feel in the vagina, but does not extend outside the body. IUDs currently available in the United States do not increase a woman's risk of ectopic pregnancy, infertility, or long-term risk of infection.",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;An IUD is an ideal method if you do not plan to become pregnant for at least one year (or longer) or you want a method that is highly effective and does not require daily or weekly attention. IUDs are also appropriate for women who do not want to or cannot use estrogen.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     IUDs have relatively few side effects, and are reversible. If you decide you want to become pregnant, you can do so by having the IUD removed by a health care professional. IUDs do not affect your chance of becoming pregnant after the IUD is removed so you can try to get pregnant right away.",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There is a small risk that the IUD will come out during your period. You should check your IUD once per month, after your menstrual period, by finding the strings inside the vagina. If you cannot feel the strings, use a backup method (eg, condoms) until you can see a doctor or nurse to be sure the IUD is still there. There is a very low risk of developing an infection after placement of the IUD, and of improper placement.",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If you become pregnant while using an IUD, you need an ultrasound to be sure that the pregnancy is inside the uterus, rather than in the fallopian tube (called an ectopic pregnancy). The IUD should be removed when the pregnancy is discovered. (See",

"     Sterilization is a procedure that permanently prevents a person from becoming pregnant or able to have children. Tubal ligation and vasectomy are the two most common sterilization procedures. Sterilization should be considered permanent, and should only be considered after a careful discussion of all available options with a healthcare provider. (See",

The procedure can be done in an operating room as a day surgery or in the office when Essure is used (see below). Women who have recently delivered a baby can undergo tubal ligation before going home. It may be done at other times as well. A separate topic review is available. (See",

"     ). Over the following three-month period, the fallopian tissue around the coil grows into the coil, causing blockage of the fallopian tubes in most women. The woman is given local anesthesia (numbing medicine is injected into the cervix to prevent pain) before the coil is placed.",
"    </p>",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Glycogen is the stored form of glucose and serves as a buffer for glucose needs. It is composed of long polymers of a 1-4 linked glucose, interrupted by a 1-6 linked branch point every 4 to 10 residues. Glycogen is formed in periods of dietary carbohydrate loading and broken down when glucose demand is high or dietary availability is low (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \" href=\"UTD.htm?4/62/5089\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There are a number of inborn errors of glucose and glycogen metabolism that result from mutations in genes for virtually all of the proteins involved in glycogen synthesis, degradation (glycogenosis), or regulation. Those disorders that result in abnormal storage of glycogen are known as glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). They have largely been categorized by number according to the chronology of recognition of the responsible enzyme defect (",

"     table 1",

"    ). The age of onset varies from in utero to adulthood.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    This topic will provide a brief overview of the inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism (glycogenoses). The individual disorders are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Glycogen is most abundant in liver and skeletal muscle, which are most affected by disorders of glycogen metabolism. The physiologic importance of a given enzyme determines the clinical manifestations of the disease.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Hypoglycemia",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The main role of glycogen in the liver is to store glucose for release to tissues that are unable to synthesize significant amounts during fasting. A disorder of hepatic glycogen metabolism should be considered in patients who present with fasting hypoglycemia and ketosis, with or without hepatomegaly, and whose symptoms improve with eating or glucose administration (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51949 \" href=\"UTD.htm?42/46/43756\">",

The major manifestations of disorders of glycogen metabolism affecting muscle are muscle pain, cramps, exercise intolerance and easy fatigability, progressive weakness, and myoglobinuria.",
"   </p>",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The goal of alcohol detoxification is threefold: to manage symptoms of alcohol withdrawal; to prevent serious events (seizures, delirium tremens, or death); and to bridge patients to treatment for maintaining long-term recovery.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Alcohol use disorders are common, with a 12 month prevalence in the United States of about 8.5 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?4/16/4361/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Despite the high prevalence, fewer than half of patients with alcohol use disorders are appropriately diagnosed when seen in primary care and less than one quarter with alcohol dependence receive treatment [",

"     1-4",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The primary care physician is in a unique position to screen for alcohol abuse and initiate treatment as needed. Most patients with alcohol abuse will benefit from structured intervention but not all patients with alcohol use disorders need detoxification [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?4/16/4361/abstract/5,6\">",
"     5,6",

"    Criteria for selecting patients who may appropriately be detoxified from alcohol in the ambulatory setting and protocols for outpatient detoxification will be reviewed here. Non-ambulatory treatment of more severe alcohol withdrawal; screening for alcohol abuse; and initial assessment and maintenance treatment of alcohol use disorders are discussed separately. (See",

"     PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF WITHDRAWAL",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The alcohol withdrawal syndrome results from sudden reduction in chronic alcohol use. Excessive alcohol drinking for even one week can lead to mild withdrawal symptoms, and excessive drinking for over one month leads to significant withdrawal symptoms [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Two opposing neurotransmitter systems primarily determine overall arousal of the central nervous system. The major excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which acts on the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) system, while the major inhibitory neurotransmitter is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Transmission of GABA is directly enhanced by alcohol and leads to reduced neuronal activity. Neuronal inhibition is responsible for alcohol's sedative effects such as motor incoordination and cognitive impairment [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?4/16/4361/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Chronic exposure to alcohol leads to a compensatory reduction in GABA receptor function; the brain becomes habituated to alcohol such that increasingly larger doses of alcohol are needed to have the same sedative effects. Chronic alcohol exposure also upregulates the NMDA receptor [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?4/16/4361/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Sudden reduction in chronic alcohol intake leads to overactivation of the excitatory NMDA system relative to the GABA system. (See",

"   </p>",

A patient who has been sober for five days or more and shows no signs of withdrawal is unlikely to develop significant withdrawal symptoms and can be referred for follow-up care.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The next step is to determine the appropriate treatment setting. A medical evaluation should be performed to rule out serious unstable medical or psychiatric conditions that would complicate alcohol withdrawal treatment and indicate a need for inpatient management. Unstable medical conditions include:",

Typically, laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, glucose, liver function and renal function tests, urinalysis, urine drug testing. Premenopausal women should have an HCG test. An EKG is suggested for patients over 50 years, or if there is a history of cardiac problems. A chest x-ray may be indicated for patients with chronic respiratory problems or respiratory symptoms.",

"      The goal of alcohol detoxification is threefold: to manage symptoms of alcohol withdrawal; to prevent serious events (seizures, delirium tremens or death); and to bridge patients to treatment for maintaining longterm recovery. (See",
