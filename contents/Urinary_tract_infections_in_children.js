[45]  [46]Circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) urine reagent strip: a rapid ELISA test which detects adult worm gut-associated glycoproteins and eggs with a sensitivity of 88.2% (for glycoproteins) and 95.8% (for eggs). Specificity is 100%. Detects S mansoni and S haematobium. It is used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool to assess the success of treatment. [34]</p>",
