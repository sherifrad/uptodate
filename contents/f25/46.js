"       What is angle-closure glaucoma?",
"      </span>",
"      &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Glaucoma is a disease that damages the main nerve in the eye, called the &ldquo;optic nerve.&rdquo; There are 2 types of glaucoma. Angle-closure glaucoma (also called &ldquo;narrow angle glaucoma&rdquo;) is the less common type. The more common type is called &ldquo;open angle glaucoma.&rdquo;",
"     </p>",
"     <p>",
"      Glaucoma is usually caused by pressure inside the eye. Angle-closure glaucoma happens when the fluid-draining system in the eye gets blocked. This causes eye pressure to rise quickly. It is different from open-angle glaucoma, which happens when eye pressure builds up slowly.",

At low concentrations, this causes an alteration of bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium and leakage of potassium and phosphorous resulting in a bacteriostatic effect. At high concentrations of chlorhexidine, the cytoplasmic contents of the bacterial cell precipitate and result in cell death.",

"      Grasp the mandible with both hands; the thumbs rest inside the mouth on the ridge of the mandible adjacent to the molars, and the fingers wrap around the outside of the jaw. Some physicians prefer to place the thumbs on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. In this case, the thumbs must be wrapped with gauze to protect them when reduction is accomplished because the masseters can contract with tremendous force. Some clinicians also use shortened tongue blades on the upper and lower surfaces of the thumbs as well. The gauze should be positioned so that the trailing appendage or string exits the mouth and is easily grasped with McGill forceps in the event that the gauze is dislodged during the reduction.",
"     </li>",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In some cases of speech and language impairment, an etiology can be determined and an appropriate intervention strategy can be initiated. A hearing aid, as an example, can be prescribed for a child with a language disorder resulting from hearing loss, whereas surgery may be considered for a resonance disorder secondary to nasal polyps or enlarged adenoids. By comparison, for many speech and language disorders, the etiology cannot be clearly identified, or the disorder is one manifestation of a larger condition. In these cases, the goals of the assessment are to describe the impairment and recommend a plan for intervention [",

"     History",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The adequacy of the child's speech and language skills should be assessed in relation to the norm and to his or her cognitive ability. The speech and language pathologist uses data gathered from various sources to perform this assessment:",

"     Initial evaluation",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The clinician asks the parents questions that clarify or enhance information that has been submitted on the questionnaire. The responses on the questionnaire and the interview provide data that help to determine whether the child has had a favorable, stimulating environment in which to develop speech and language skills at a level consistent with his or her chronologic age and overall potential.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Information about the child's cultural and linguistic background is necessary to appropriately assess and treat speech and language impairment [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Children who are more proficient (dominant) in a language other than English should have at least part of their evaluation conducted in their dominant language. Children who speak a language other than English should be tested in their native language; evaluations should be performed by a speech language pathologist who is fluent in the child's native language. An interpreter must be employed if a fluent speech and language pathologist is not available. Potential problems in the use of interpreters include errors in translation, failure of the interpreter to share information from the case history interview, and a tendency of the interpreter to minimize problems. The occurrence of such problems can be reduced by thoroughly training interpreters in the diagnostic process [",

"     Standardized tests",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The value of standardized tests as the sole tool for the assessment of communication problems has been challenged because \"standardized tests destroy the fundamental social-interactive quality of communication. Many of the tests attempt to isolate and measure particular aspects of communication\" without considering the others [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, some objective tests do provide quantitative measures of a child's specific skills. In addition, objective scores often are necessary for placement in special education programs and are useful for subsequent comparison. Standardized assessment tools that are chosen carefully and used appropriately provide worthwhile information.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The child's performance in specific speech and language areas, such as phonologic ability, vocabulary comprehension, and grammatic usage, is measured objectively using the most recently standardized, norm-referenced tests for a particular age group. No uniformly applicable test battery for this assessment exists; the clinician uses his or her expertise to select from among the large number of tests available.",

"     Observation and qualitative analysis of performance",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Observation and qualitative analysis of the child's performance supplement objective test results and are essential for making a diagnosis and devising a treatment plan. In the very young or uncooperative child, parental report and observation of the child at play provide the information necessary to make judgments about the precursors of speech and language development: the adequacy of speech and language, nonverbal cognition, and social interaction. Precursors of normal speech and language development are listed in the table (",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    For older children, the clinician can gather important data about the child's ability to communicate in conversational situations through close observation during informal interaction with the child or watching the child's interaction with his parent or sibling. In the qualitative analysis, the skilled clinician looks at how the child arrived at the answer, instead of whether the answer was right or wrong. As an example, does the child:",

"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The clinician should note the kinds of test modifications that were helpful to the child, such as repeating instructions and stressing key words, shortening the length of the stimulus, prodding or encouraging to take risks, requiring eye contact during oral instruction, or encouraging repetition of instruction before proceeding. These subjective observations provide valuable information for making the diagnosis and for devising a management plan.",

"    The clinician should communicate this information to the child's parents at a conference and in writing. The clinician can choose to have the child present at this meeting or to have a separate conference with the child to present the information at a level that he or she will understand.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A definitive diagnosis cannot always be made during the initial assessment. In these cases, the assessment provides a baseline for comparison with follow-up assessment (monitoring). Diagnostic therapy may be recommended for those children for whom more observation is necessary before arriving at a diagnosis or determining a management plan (eg, children who are frightened in the clinical setting) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Specific suggestions for appropriately stimulating language should be given to parents, teachers, and others involved in the child's care. As an example, providing a language model that is appropriate to the child's linguistic development (eg, sounds, single words, phrases, simple sentences) is important. Parents may be advised to comment about daily activities rather than overusing direct questioning that may decrease verbal output from the child. Parents are encouraged to accept less than perfect productions (eg, word approximations) when the child's intent is clear.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Children with speech and oral language disorders are at high risk for developing learning disabilities (eg, academic problems) when they enter school [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/2-5\">",
"     2-5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Parents should know how to advocate for their children in the school system by making sure they get the services they need and ensuring the condition is monitored through periodic reevaluation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     TREATMENT",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The treatment plan for a child with speech or language disorder is tailored to his or her individual needs, but all treatment plans have common components. Baseline data are used to set short-term, long-term, and functional outcome goals [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The speech and language pathologist then employs facilitation techniques to elicit specific changes in the child's behavior. Some clinicians use a highly structured approach in which the principles of behavior modification (stimulus-response-reinforcement) are strictly followed; others use a less structured intervention that is more child-led. As an example, \"enhanced milieu teaching\" is an intervention that occurs in play-based interaction sessions [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A combination of high- and low-structure approaches may be appropriate, depending upon the type of problem and the stage of the therapeutic process.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Functional outcomes are outcomes that can be measured in terms of experience in the child's life; they extend beyond the individual treatment session to the real world environment [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Children differ in their abilities to apply what is learned in one context to other contexts. As an example, children often have difficulty using new speech or language skills in situations other than the treatment setting. Collaboration with family members, caregivers, and educators in helping the child exercise these new skills is a key factor in the success of the treatment.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Emphasis on the practice of inclusion in public schools has been increasing; children with special needs (eg, speech and language impairments) are served within the classroom, rather than being pulled out for treatment. However, evidence demonstrating improved progress for children with language disorders in inclusion settings is lacking [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26343/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, some types of intervention are more suited to inclusion settings than are others. The carryover practice for a learned skill, as an example, works well in an inclusion setting. In contrast, new skills may be better acquired in individual therapy.",

This preference was illustrated in a study in which 30 preschool-age children with severe phonologic disorders were randomized to receive four months of therapy followed by four months of no treatment or four months of no treatment followed by four months of therapy [",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Neural tube defects are the cause of chronic disability of between 70,000 and 100,000 individuals in the United States. The incidence of neural tube defects ranges from one to seven per 1000 live births, depending on ethnic, geographic, and nutritional factors [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/1-3\">",
"     1-3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Myelomeningocele (spina bifida) is the most common neural tube defect and is the most severe birth defect that is compatible with survival.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Myelomeningocele is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. Because the neural tissue is exposed, it is also known as open spinal dysraphism, or spina bifida aperta. By contrast, occult spinal dysraphism, is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, without a corresponding epithelial defect, and neural tissue is not exposed. There are many different forms of occult spinal dysraphism, ranging from asymptomatic vertebral anomalies, to clinically significant defects in the spinal cord and related structures. Occult spinal dysraphism is discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?20/27/20921?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Pathogenesis and types of occult spinal dysraphism\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In the early 1950s, the survival rate for individuals with myelomeningocele was about 10 percent. Today, large numbers of children with myelomeningocele are surviving into adulthood because of advances in the management of several important complications [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/4,5\">",
"     4,5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, optimal treatment requires specialized care to prevent, monitor, and treat a variety of potential complications that can affect function, quality of life, and survival. This care is ideally provided by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pediatric subspecialties of neurosurgery, orthopedics, neurology, urology, and rehabilitation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Access to physical and occupational therapists, nutritionists, social workers, wound specialists, and psychologists is also helpful.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Because of increased survival, many individuals with myelomeningocele now live long enough to transition to adult medical providers. This presents new challenges because adult providers may lack experience in managing these patients. The problem is compounded by the fact that many adults with myelomeningocele have failed to acquire the skills needed to live independently and therefore remain dependent on aging parents who will soon be unable to care for them.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    An overview of the management of myelomeningocele and its complications will be presented here. The embryology, pathophysiology, and prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele are discussed separately. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?32/62/33767?source=see_link\">",

"     OUTCOME AND ETHICS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Until the 1950s, hydrocephalus was an important cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with myelomeningocele. The introduction of the valve for the ventricular cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunt in the 1950s offered effective treatment for hydrocephalus, and presented the possibility of long-term survival for some infants.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    At first, some providers, including John Lorber in England, advocated selective treatment for infants with myelomeningocele, reasoning that many of these children are a burden for themselves, their family, and society. They advocated active treatment only for infants whom they considered to have the best chance of a good neurologic outcome, amounting to 30 percent of newborns with myelomeningocele [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/7-9\">",
"     7-9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The remainder were selected for nontreatment based on criteria that included hydrocephalus, paraplegia, severe kyphosis, and associated congenital defects. These children were given only supportive nursing care, and antibiotics and artificial feeding were withheld. Survival of an untreated child was considered an unacceptable outcome.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Today most centers treat all viable newborns aggressively without selection. Nonselective treatment increases overall survival several fold, and there is little difference in functionality as compared with individuals surviving selective treatment protocols. Nonselective treatment is the current standard of care in the United States [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/10,11\">",
"     10,11",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The long-term outcome of nonselective treatment for myelomeningocele was outlined in a review of 118 infants with myelomeningocele [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Among the 71 patients who were available for follow-up at 20 to 25 years of age, the overall mortality was 24 percent and continued to increase into young adulthood. Eighty-six percent of patients had undergone cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion and 95 percent of those with shunts had undergone at least one shunt revision. Thirty-two percent had undergone release of tethered cord, after which 97 percent had improvement or stabilization in their preoperative symptoms. Eighty-five percent were attending or had graduated from high school",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    college.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Similar long-term mortality estimates were given in a population-based study from the United Kingdom [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. For infants born with spina bifida between 1985 and 2003, 71 percent survived until one year of age (56 percent of those with hydrocephalus and 88 percent of those without hydrocephalus). Survival rates decreased slightly with advancing age among those with hydrocephalus, falling to 50 percent by 20 years.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Thus, nonselective treatment leads to high levels of function and independence for the majority of individuals with myelomeningocele, but most also require neurosurgical intervention. Outcomes will probably be better in subsequent cohorts of patients, due to improvements in management of the neurologic and urinary tract complications.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In the Netherlands between 1997 and 2004, 22 children with myelomeningocele were euthanized during the neonatal period, following a protocol intended to reduce suffering in terminally ill infants known as the Groningen Protocol [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26344/abstract/13,14\">",
"     13,14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This form of active euthanasia has prompted intense controversy and criticism, in part because of the difficulties of objectively determining suffering in an infant, predicting survival and quality of life, and because the infant patient cannot participate in the decision about his or her treatment [",

The irrigation is usually performed every other day, but can take as long as two hours to complete. ACE achieves continence in approximately 85 percent of patients with myelomeningocele [",

"      Nonselective management describes the practice of providing full surgical and medical intervention for all patients, and is the standard of care in the United States for infants with myelomeningocele. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Shortly after birth of an infant with myelomeningocele, the lesion should be covered and dressed, and prophylactic antibiotics initiated. The infant should be evaluated for the possibility of associated congenital anomalies. Only non-latex gloves and equipment should be used, to avoid latex sensitization. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",

"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The back lesion should be surgically closed, preferably within the first 72 hours after birth if the infant is stable. For the next few weeks, the infant should be monitored closely for the development of hydrocephalus, using serial head circumference measures and ventricular ultrasounds. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H7\">",
"       'Surgical closure'",

"      </a>",
"      ). However, these infants should be followed with serial head circumference measurements and ventricular ultrasounds every one to three weeks, depending on the level of concern, until the head growth has stabilized.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      If the ventricular size increases rapidly, we recommend insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (",

"      Throughout life, patients with myelomeningocele should have serial evaluations of their neurologic function, including signs and symptoms of spinal cord or brainstem compression. Any changes should prompt evaluation for shunt malfunction. If this possibility is excluded, then tethered cord and brainstem compression from the Chiari II malformation should be considered. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H10\">",

"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Nearly all patients with myelomeningocele have bladder dysfunction (neurogenic bladder). Treatment with early initiation of clean intermittent catheterization and usually with prophylactic antibiotics and anticholinergic medication reduces the risk of progressive renal disease. Changes in bladder function may be a sign of an acute neurologic complication (eg, shunt malfunction or tethered cord). (See",

"      Scoliosis is common in children with myelomeningocele, because the spinal cord lesion causes paralysis of the musculature that is necessary to stabilize the vertebral column. The development of new or progressive scoliosis may be a sign of an acute neurologic complication (eg, shunt malfunction or tethered cord). (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Morbidity and mortality due to acute diarrhea is significant even in the United States where diarrhea is more often than not a \"nuisance disease\" in the normally healthy individual [",

"    Most cases of acute diarrhea are self-limited, whether the cause is an infection, including viruses, or non-infectious. Definitions, epidemiology, and etiologies of acute diarrhea in the United States and other developed countries will be reviewed here. A diagnostic and treatment approach to acute diarrhea, more details on the responsible pathogens, and chronic diarrhea are discussed separately. (See",

"     DEFINITIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Diarrhea is defined as stool weight in excess of 200 grams per day. However, this definition is of little clinical value, since collecting and weighing stools is neither practical nor required except in a clinical research setting. A good working definition is three or more loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based upon an individual baseline.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Diarrhea reflects increased water content of the stool, whether due to impaired water absorption",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    active water secretion by the bowel. In severe infectious diarrhea, the number of stools may reach 20 or more per day, with defecation occurring every 20 or 30 minutes. In this situation, the total daily volume of stool may exceed two liters, with resultant volume depletion and hypokalemia. Most patients with acute diarrhea have three to seven movements per day with total stool volume less than one liter per day. When diarrhea lasts for 14 days it can be considered persistent; the term chronic generally refers to diarrhea that lasts for at least one month [",

"     EPIDEMIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The overall burden of acute infectious diarrhea in the United States and other developed countries has not been well-studied in contrast to this entity in the developing world. Most series have focused on specific groups of patients or specific pathogens.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Incidence",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The incidence of acute diarrhea in the general population is probably best estimated by prospective studies that incorporated active surveillance in well-defined cohorts. Only a few such studies have been published:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The Foodborne Disease Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducted a population-based telephone survey of 12,075 persons in the United States from 1998 to 1999 to assess diarrheal illness [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/5\">",
"       5",
"      </a>",
"      ]. Six percent reported an acute diarrheal illness at some point during the four weeks preceding the interview (annualized rate, 0.72 episodes per person-year). Rates of illness were highest among children younger than five years (1.1 episodes per person-year) and were lowest in persons aged &ge;65 years (0.32 episodes per person-year).",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      A study in 2000 that estimated the economic burden of both infectious and noninfectious gastrointestinal and liver disease in the United States found that the most prevalent diseases were non-foodborne gastroenteritis (135 million cases per year) and foodborne illness (76 million cases per year) [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/6\">",
"       6",
"      </a>",
"      ].",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      A study from England that included 9776 adults reported an incidence of infectious diarrhea of 19.4, 3.3, and 0.15 cases per 100 person years in a community cohort, those presenting to general practitioners, and cases reaching the national surveillance system, respectively [",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      A retrospective, cross-sectional telephone survey of 3500 Canadian residents from February 2001 to February 2002 reported an incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness of 1.3 episodes per person-year [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/8\">",
"       8",
"      </a>",
"      ].",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The incidence of gastroenteritis was 45 per 100 person years in a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands involving 2206 people from the general population [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/9\">",

"      ].",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A report from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that foodborne diseases account for approximately 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5000 deaths each year in the United States based upon surveillance data from multiple sources [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. While acute diarrhea occurs in most cases of foodborne illness, there are other causes of acute diarrhea that would not be captured in this type of survey.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Waterborne outbreaks associated with recreational water (eg, swimming or wading pools) are another source of acute diarrhea. It has been estimated that approximately one-half of these outbreaks involve gastroenteritis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The outbreaks were associated most frequently with Cryptosporidium (50 percent) in treated water sources and with toxigenic Escherichia coli (25 percent) and norovirus (25 percent) in freshwater sources.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Limitations of the data",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The prevalence of documented infectious diarrhea is grossly underestimated, since many patients do not seek medical attention and testing is not always done when patients do contact their physician [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In two studies cited above, for example, only 22 percent of patients with gastroenteritis consulted a physician [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ], and only 5 percent of patients had submitted a stool sample [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A report from the CDC estimated that known pathogens account for approximately 14 of 76 million (18 percent) of annual cases of foodborne illness [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    One study analyzed 1783 surveys from United States physicians who had seen a patient with acute diarrhea in the previous year to evaluate factors that influence the decision to obtain stool cultures [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Stool cultures were requested from 79 percent of those with bloody stools, 40 percent of those without bloody stools, and in 53 percent of those who had diarrhea lasting for more than three days. On multivariate analysis, patient factors significantly associated with stool culture requests were the presence of bloody stools, a diagnosis of AIDS, diarrhea lasting longer than three days, travel to a developing country, the need for intravenous rehydration, and fever.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Costs",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Diarrhea results in 300 to 400 deaths per year in children in the United States, approximately 200,000 hospitalizations, 1.5 million outpatient visits, and more than one billion dollars in direct medical costs [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26345/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, other more subtle measures of cost to society from acute diarrheal illness in the United States (such as missed days from work) have not been well-studied. To perform such estimates, one would also need to factor in chronic illnesses (eg, some cases of ankylosing spondylitis, thyroid, renal, neuromuscular disease, and irritable bowel syndrome) that may result from the acute episode [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The successful transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life is dependent upon significant physiologic changes that occur at birth. In almost all infants (90 percent), these changes are successfully completed at delivery without requiring any special assistance. However, about 10 percent of infants will need some intervention, and 1 percent will require extensive resuscitative measures at birth [",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26346/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Neonates requiring resuscitation are inevitably born in locations where resuscitation is uncommon because most newborns are healthy and do not require additional special assistance. In these settings, the need for resuscitation is not anticipated in the most infants who require resuscitation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26346/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. As a result, at every birthing location, personnel who are adequately trained in neonatal resuscitation should be readily available to perform neonatal resuscitation whether or not problems are anticipated.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In all instances, at least one healthcare provider is assigned primary responsibility for the newborn infant. This person should have the necessary skills to evaluate the infant, and, if required, to initiate resuscitation procedures such as positive pressure ventilation and chest compressions. In addition, either this person or another who is immediately available should have the requisite knowledge and skills to carry out a complete neonatal resuscitation including endotracheal intubation and administration of medications.",
"   </p>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26346/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    By 2005, the NRP had trained two million health care providers in the United States and was a model for similar neonatal resuscitation programs in over 100 countries [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26346/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The NRP has been updated five times since its inception. The most recent version is based upon the 2010 AHA, AAP, and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) neonatal resuscitative guidelines [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/46/26346/abstract/1\">",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In our institution, all healthcare providers who care for newborn infants (physicians, nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, and respiratory therapists) are required to be NRP trained. It is recommended all delivery room personnel complete the NRP in an effort to improve their individual and group performance in neonatal resuscitation.",

No further resuscitative actions are required if the infant responds with adequate spontaneous respirations and a heart rate above 100 beats per minute. (See",

Hypothermia in the newborn increases oxygen consumption and metabolic demands, which can impair subsequent resuscitative efforts, especially in the asphyxiated or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant.

A simple calculation can be used to determine the depth of insertion (referred to as the 7-8-9 or Tochen's rule). The distance measured in cm from the tip of the ETT to the lip of the infant is calculated as the infant's weight in kg plus \"6\". So for a 1 kg infant, the depth of insertion is 7 cm. This rule accurately places the tip of the ETT just above the midtracheal position in infants with birth weight (BW) &ge;750 g. However, the Tochen's rule is not adequate for ETT placement in infants with BW &lt;750 g.

"     <li>",
"      Most infants successfully transfer from intrauterine to extrauterine life without any special assistance. However, about 10 percent of newborns will need some intervention, and 1 percent will require extensive resuscitative measures at birth.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Because the need for resuscitation is not anticipated in the majority of neonates, personnel who are adequately trained should be readily available to perform neonatal resuscitation at every birthing location, whether or not problems are anticipated. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Anticipation of resuscitation need'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Infants who are more likely to require resuscitation can be identified by maternal and neonatal risk factors, and the presence of antepartum and delivery room complications. Care providers skilled in neonatal resuscitation should be present and equipment should be prepared prior to the birth of the high-risk infant. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'High-risk delivery'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Preterm infants are more likely to require resuscitation and develop complications from resuscitation than term infants. If a preterm birth can be anticipated and time permits, it is preferable to transfer the mother prior to delivery to a perinatal center. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",

"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      If there is meconium stained amniotic fluid and the infant is not vigorous, suctioning of residual meconium should be performed. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",

"      .)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      After the above initial steps are completed, if further resuscitative efforts are required or if resuscitation was anticipated, pulse oximetry should be initiated to determine oxygen saturation levels and to guide the administration of appropriate amounts of oxygen.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) is required if the infant has an inadequate respiratory effort or a heart rate &lt;100 beats per minute (bpm). PPV is started with bag-mask ventilation (BMV) at a rate of 40 to 60 times per minute for 30 seconds, after which the heart rate is measured.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      We suggest that resuscitation begin with blended oxygen or room air and the concentration of oxygen is adjusted based on targeted oxygen saturation levels measured by pulse oximetry (",
"      <a class=\"grade\" href=\"._grade_5?title=Grade 2B\">",
"       Grade 2B",
"      </a>",
"      ). In our practice, we initiate resuscitation with room air in infants greater than 30 weeks gestation, and use 30 percent oxygen concentration for those &le;30 weeks gestation. (See",

"      Intubation is needed if tracheal suctioning for meconium is required, BMV is ineffective or prolonged, or chest compressions are being performed. (See",

"       'Endotracheal intubation'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Chest compressions are required if the infant's heart rate remains &lt;60 bpm despite adequate ventilation for 30 seconds. Chest compressions must always be accompanied by PPV. Chest compression rate is 90 per minute accompanied by 30 ventilations per minute with one ventilation interposed after every third compression. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H21\">",
"       'Chest compressions'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",

"      Drugs are rarely required in neonatal resuscitation. However, if the heart rate remains &lt;60 bpm despite adequate ventilation and chest compressions, intravenous administration of",

"      </a>",
