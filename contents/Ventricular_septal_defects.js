"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The murmur is usually higher up in the left parasternal region and results from flow across the pulmonic valve. Therefore, the murmur is much softer, mid or ejection systolic instead of holosystolic, and the second heart sound may have a wide and fixed (not changing with breathing) split.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An echocardiogram will demonstrate the defect and site of shunting by colour flow.</p>",

"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Mitral regurgitation results in a holosystolic murmur most prominent at the mitral area, and may radiate to the axilla or the lower left sternal border depending on the eccentricity of the mitral regurgitation jet.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> An echocardiogram will reveal posterior motion of valve leaflets during mid-systole without evidence of a ventricular septal defects (VSDs).</p>",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Tricuspid regurgitation results in a holosystolic murmur at the lower left parasternal region. A characteristic finding in tricuspid regurgitation shared with other right-sided murmurs is an increase in the murmur intensity with inspiration (Carvalho's sign).",

"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Typical infant presents in the newborn period with a murmur and cyanosis. The diagnosis may have been made antenatally on fetal echocardiogram. Some infants present at a later age with increasing cyanosis, murmur, or hypercyanotic spells. May be associated with genetic syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome.Physical examination may reveal significant tachypnoea and cyanosis in severe cases, an increased right ventricular (parasternal) impulse, a single second heart sound, and a harsh systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left sternal border. The intensity of the murmur depends on the degree of pulmonary stenosis and decreases with severe stenosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Echocardiogram will show the presence of the 3 other key findings in addition to the VSD (i.e., presence of pulmonic stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy).</p>",
