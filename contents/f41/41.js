"     Potassium is a mineral that is found in many foods. It keeps the heart beating regularly, helps to maintain fluid balance, and allows the nerves and muscles to work properly.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The kidneys are the main organ that controls the correct level of potassium in the blood. People who take certain medicines or who have chronic kidney disease must sometimes, under the direction of their clinician, limit the amount of potassium in their diet to keep their potassium level close to normal.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     This article will discuss the normal level of potassium, how it is measured in the blood, and how to eat a low potassium diet. A discussion of other treatments for chronic kidney disease is available separately. (See",

"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Normally, the level of potassium in your body is balanced by eating foods that contain potassium and getting rid of excess potassium in the urine. However, some people with chronic kidney disease cannot get rid of enough potassium in their urine because the kidneys do not work well.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     In these people, the level of potassium in the blood can become higher than normal, causing a condition known as hyperkalemia (hyper=high, kal=potassium, emia=in the blood). Eating a low potassium diet can lower the risk of developing hyperkalemia.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The potassium level is measured by taking a small sample of blood from a vein. A typical normal range for potassium is 3.5 to 5",
"     <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"      meq/L.",
"     </span>",
"     A level greater than 6",

"     or less than 3",
"     <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"      meq/L",
"     </span>",
"     is considered dangerous. Blood potassium must be well regulated to prevent serious complications.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Hyperkalemia does not usually cause noticeable symptoms until the potassium level is very high, usually &gt;6 to 6.5",
"     <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"      meq/L.",
"     </span>",
"     At this level, dangerous complications can develop, including an irregular heart rhythm, severe muscle weakness, paralysis, or even sudden death.",

"     ]. However, most people with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury should eat less than 1500 to 2700 mg of potassium per day. People with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease have kidney function (ie, glomerular filtration rate, or \"GFR\") below 45",

"    <p>",
"     Prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate gland, an organ that forms a ring around the urethra, near its connection to the bladder (",
"     <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/32/37382\">",
"      figure 1",
"     </a>",
"     ). The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Prostate cancer is advanced if it has spread beyond the prostate gland and the area around the prostate. Some men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have advanced, or stage IV, prostate cancer. In other men, advanced prostate cancer will develop after they were originally treated for localized disease.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Advanced prostate cancer is usually treated with a combination of treatments, which may include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation. Although advanced prostate cancer is not curable, treatment can often help to control the cancer for prolonged periods of time. This can help to reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     This article will discuss the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. A separate article discusses the treatment of stage I to III prostate cancer. (See",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Stage IV prostate cancer (also called metastatic prostate cancer) has spread outside the prostate (beyond the seminal vesicles, to areas like the bladder or rectum) (",

"     1-6",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Flexion and extension are the primary movements of the fingers. Abduction and adduction can be performed at the MCP joints. The thumb is capable of opposition, abduction, adduction, and retropulsion, in addition to flexion and extension. The thumb is discussed below. (See",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H8\">",

"    ]. The ulnar and radial arteries unite in the palm to form a small deep palmar arch and a larger superficial palmar arch.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The deep palmar arch is supplied mainly from the radial artery and gives off the princeps pollicis artery to the thumb and the radial digital artery of the index finger. The princeps pollicis artery bifurcates into two palmar digital arteries that run on each side of the thumb.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The superficial palmar arch is supplied mainly by the ulnar artery and gives off three common palmar digital arteries that provide blood to structures in the palm and flow distally toward the fingers. Each common palmar digital vessel bifurcates near the finger web space forming two proper palmar digital arteries that flow distally along both sides of the middle finger and one side the index and little finger. The ulnar side of the little finger is supplied by the palmar digital artery that branches directly off the ulnar artery.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The digital arteries give rise to numerous deep and superficial branches that supply the structures of the fingers. The digital arteries run with digital nerves from the ulnar and median nerve. In the palm the arteries lie palmar to the nerve but in the digits this alignment is reversed.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Capillary refill is the test used most often to assess finger perfusion. Normal capillary refill is generally less than two seconds, but may be slightly longer in the elderly and patients with certain diseases (eg, diabetes) [",

"    The median nerve supplies sensation to the radial side of the palm and the palmar surface of the thumb, index finger, long finger, and the radial side of the ring finger. It also supplies sensation to the dorsal surfaces of these fingers distal to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. The ulnar nerve supplies sensation to the hypothenar eminence, the palmar and dorsal surfaces of the little finger, and the ulnar side of the ring finger. The radial nerve innervates the dorsal surface of the palm and fingers, from the thumb to the radial side of the ring finger, proximal to the DIP joints.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The median nerve innervates the muscles involved in pinching (thumb apposition). In the forearm, the median nerve innervates the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), while its anterior interosseus branch innervates the flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) of the index and long fingers. As the median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel, it splits into the recurrent motor branch and gives off a number of palmar digital nerves which travel with the digital arteries. The recurrent motor branch innervates the abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis, and the lumbrical muscles of the index and long finger. The palmar digital nerves run on the lateral and medial sides of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the radial side on the ring finger.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The ulnar nerve innervates the muscles that provide grip strength. In the forearm, the ulnar nerve innervates the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) of the ring and small fingers. In the hand, the deep motor branch innervates the abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, palmaris brevis, all interossei, the two ulnar lumbricals, adductor pollicis, and the deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis. The superficial branch gives off palmar digital nerves to the little finger and the ulnar side of the ring finger.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the hand. The radial nerve divides at the proximal forearm into superficial and deep branches. The deep posterior interosseus branch innervates all the extensor muscles in the hand including the extensor digitorum communis, extensor digiti minimi, extensor indicis proprius, extensor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and abductor pollicis longus.",

"     MAJOR JOINTS",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint is a hinge joint with a range of motion of approximately 0 to 80 degrees of flexion (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51038 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?5/32/5642\">",
"     figure 6",

"    ]. The joint is stabilized by the joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the volar plate. The lateral bands of the extensor tendons cross the DIP joint and form the terminal slip of the extensor tendon as it attaches to the dorsum of the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum profundus attaches to the palmar aspect of the distal phalanx to enable DIP joint flexion (",

"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is another hinge joint. Its range of motion is approximately 0 to 120 degrees of flexion. The PIP joint is stabilized by the joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the volar plate. The volar plate consists of thick fibrocartilaginous tissue on the palmar surface and prevents hyperextension. The collateral ligaments prevent radial and ulnar displacement of the PIP joint and remain tight throughout its range of motion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The dorsal surface of the PIP joint includes the central slip of the extensor digitorum tendon, which attaches to the middle phalanx. The lateral bands of the extensor tendon pass around the PIP joint, attaching to the base of the distal phalanx. Injury to the central slip allows the lateral bands to displace volarly, pulling the PIP joint into flexion and leading to extension of the DIP joint (boutonniere deformity). The flexor digitorum superficialis inserts just beyond the PIP joint into the volar aspect of the middle phalanx to enable PIP joint flexion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is capable of 0 to 90 degrees of flexion, 0 to 30 degrees of extension, and 0 to 20 degrees of abduction. A small amount of phalangeal rotation occurs with MCP joint motion. The MCP joints are encompassed by an articular joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and palmar (volar) ligaments. The capsule is continuous with a row of deep transverse metacarpal ligaments connecting the heads of metacarpals. These ligaments support the collateral ligaments and limit rotation and lateral movement. The collateral ligaments that support the MCP are lax in extension and become taut in flexion. This complex structure of ligaments results in more dorsal dislocations but fewer lateral dislocations and collateral ligament injuries.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The lumbricals are four small muscles that arise from the flexor digitorum profundus after passing through the flexor retinaculum. The four lumbrical tendons run along the radial side of all digits other than the thumb and insert at the level of the proximal phalanx. They are primarily involved in extension of the interphalangeal joints and also contribute to flexion of the MCP joints. The lumbricals of the index and middle fingers are innervated by the median nerve, while the ulnar nerve innervates the lumbricals of the ring and little fingers.",

"    ]. The tendons of these muscles are tethered by a dorsal hood over the MCP joint, formed by an extension of the joint capsule. Just after the extensor tendon passes over the MCP, it divides into three slips, the central slip and the lateral bands, which are described above. (See",
"    <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"     'Major joints'",
"    </a>",
"    above.)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The lateral slips diverge just past the MCP joint, where they receive contributions from the lumbrical muscle tendon on the radial side and interosseous muscle tendons on both sides of the digit. The lateral slips are connected distally by the triangular ligament and form the terminal slip just before their insertion onto the dorsum of the distal phalanx. The central slip attaches to the middle phalanx just beyond the PIP joint. The extensor mechanism is innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve and deep branches of the radial nerve.",

"    ]. The two tendons of these muscles run in pairs across the palm. The tendon of the flexor digitorum superficialis inserts on the palmar shaft of the middle phalanx of the four fingers. This allows for flexion of the PIP joint. The flexor digitorum profundus passes distally through a split in the superficialis tendon to insert at the base of the distal phalanges of the four fingers. The flexor digitorum profundus is responsible for flexion of the DIP joint.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The digital flexor system consists of membranous and retinacular tissues. The membranous tissues include the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis tendons. The retinacular portion of the sheath consists of cruciform, annular, and transverse tissues that overlie the membranous tissues. These retinacular tissues facilitate smooth gliding of the tendons and form a pulley system that enables effective finger flexion without displacement of the tendons (ie, \"bowstringing\").",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The retinacular pulley system is comprised of the palmar aponeurosis (PA) pulley, five annular (A) pulleys, and three cruciform (C) pulleys (",

"    The annular pulleys are larger and are located over and between the finger joints. The A1 pulley arises from the palmar plate and proximal portion of the proximal phalanx. It overlies the membranous sheath at the level of the MCP joint. It is released during surgical treatment of trigger finger. The A2 pulley consists of oblique fibers that overlie annular fibers and is located at the level of the proximal phalanx. The A3 pulley overlies the PIP joint. The A4 pulley also consists of oblique fibers overlying annular fibers and is located at the middle phalanx. The A5 pulley is located just proximal to the DIP joint and just proximal to the termination of the flexor sheath.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The cruciform pulleys are thin and narrow and located near the finger joints. They are able to accommodate flexion more readily than the larger annular pulleys. The C1 pulley lies distal to the A2 pulley and just proximal to the PIP joint. The C2 pulley lies between the A3 and A4 pulleys and just distal to the PIP joint. The C3 pulley lies distal to the A4 pulley and proximal to the DIP joint.",

"   <p>",
"    The area between the A1 pulley and the insertion of the flexor digitorum profundus (zone II) is often described as \"no man's land.\" This area is prone to adhesions and complications following surgery because of the complex pulley system.",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Flexion of the thumb occurs in the plane parallel to the palm; the thumb moves into the palm. Abduction occurs in the plane perpendicular to the palm; the thumb moves away from the palm. Opposition is a combination of abduction, rotation, and flexion that occurs as the thumb tip is brought to the tip of the little finger. Retropulsion is movement of the thumb dorsally beyond its natural resting position.",

"    The thumb is capable of 60 degrees of abduction. Approximately 10 to 15 degrees of hyperextension can occur at the IP and MCP joints. The IP joint is capable of 80 degrees of flexion, while the MCP and CMC joints are capable of 55 and 35 degrees, respectively.",

"    ). The flexor pollicis longus (FPL) inserts on the distal phalanx and is primarily responsible for IP flexion. The abductor pollicis longus (APL) inserts at the base of the first metacarpal and is responsible for CMC abduction and extension. The extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) inserts on the proximal phalanx and assists with MCP and CMC extension. The APL and EPB tendons run along the radial aspect of the anatomic snuffbox and are involved in DeQuervain's tenosynovitis. The extensor pollicis longus (EPL) runs along the ulnar side of the snuffbox. It inserts on the distal phalanx and contributes to MCP and IP extension.",

"    The intrinsic muscles of the thumb consist of the thenar muscles and the adductor pollicis. The adductor pollicis inserts at the base of the proximal phalanx on the radial side and is responsible for adduction and opposition. The abductor pollicis brevis (APB), flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), and opponens pollicis comprise the thenar group and are responsible for flexion, abduction, and opposition of the thumb.",

"     Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage reduction may be necessary; avoid rapid dosage escalation which may lead to further renal impairment. Use with caution in patients with unstented unilateral/bilateral renal artery stenosis. When unstented bilateral renal artery stenosis is present, use is generally avoided due to the elevated risk of deterioration in renal function unless possible benefits outweigh risks.",
"    </p>",
"    <p style=\"text-indent:0em;margin-top:2em;\">",
"     Use with caution when initiating therapy and in volume-depleted patients; may cause symptomatic hypotension with or without syncope, usually with the first several doses; correct volume depletion prior to initiation; initiate lower doses in patients with sodium or volume depletion; close monitoring of patient is required, especially with initial dosing and dosing increases; blood pressure must be lowered at a rate appropriate for the patient's clinical condition. Although dose reduction may be necessary, hypotension alone is not a reason for discontinuation of future ACE inhibitor use, especially in patients with heart failure in whom a reduction in systolic blood pressure is a desirable observation. Use caution in patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease during therapy initiation; observe closely due to the potential consequences posed by falling blood pressure (eg, MI, stroke); fluid replacement may be required to restore blood pressure; therapy may then be resumed; discontinue therapy in patients whose hypotension recurs. Use with caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis; may reduce coronary perfusion, resulting in ischemia. Use with caution in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and outflow tract obstruction since reduction in afterload may worsen symptoms associated with this condition.",
"    </p>",
"    <p style=\"text-indent:0em;margin-top:2em;\">",
"     May cause hyperkalemia; risk factors include renal dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salts; use with caution, if at all, with these agents and monitor potassium closely.",
"    </p>",
"    <p style=\"text-indent:0em;margin-top:2em;\">",
"     Use with caution before, during, or immediately after major surgery; cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative blood loss or vasodilating anesthesia increases endogenous renin release; use of ACE inhibitors perioperatively will blunt angiotensin II formation and may result in hypotension.",
"    </p>",
"    <p style=\"text-indent:0em;margin-top:2em;\">",
"     Racial differences were identified in a multicentered, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the dose-response of fosinopril in 253 children 6-16 years of age; this study found that black children required a higher dose of fosinopril (per kg body weight) in order to adequately control blood pressure (Menon, 2006); the findings of this study are consistent with adult studies assessing ACE inhibitors; consider dosage adjustments in these patients.",

"     An ACE inhibitor cough is a dry, hacking, nonproductive one that usually occurs within the first few months of treatment and should generally resolve within 1-4 weeks after discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. In pediatric patients, an isolated dry hacking cough  lasting &gt;3 weeks was reported in 7 of 42 pediatric patients (17%) receiving ACE inhibitors (von Vigier, 2000); a review of pediatric randomized-controlled ACE inhibitor trials reported a lower incidence of  3.2% (Baker-Smith, 2010). Other causes of cough should be considered (eg, pulmonary congestion in patients with heart failure) and excluded prior to discontinuation.",

"     Angioedema can occur at any time during treatment (especially following first dose). Angioedema may occur in the head, neck, extremities, or intestines; patients with angioedema of the intestines may present with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); angioedema of the larynx, glottis, or tongue may cause airway obstruction, especially in patients with a history of airway surgery. Prolonged monitoring may be required, even in patients with swelling of only the tongue (ie, without respiratory distress) because treatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines may not be sufficient; very rare fatalities have occurred with angioedema of the larynx or tongue; appropriate treatment (eg, establishing patent airway and/or SubQ epinephrine) should be readily available for patients with angioedema of larynx, glottis, or tongue, in whom airway obstruction is likely to occur.",

Onset of neutropenia is usually within 3 months of fosinopril initiation; closely monitor CBC with differential for the first 3 months of therapy and periodically thereafter in these patients; neutrophil count generally returns to baseline within 2 weeks of discontinuation.",

"     Due to adverse events observed in some animal studies, fosinopril is considered pregnancy category C during the first trimester. Based on human data, fosinopril is considered pregnancy category D if used during the second and third trimesters (per the manufacturer; however, one study suggests that fetal injury may occur at anytime during pregnancy). First trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors may cause major congenital malformations. An increased risk of cardiovascular and/or central nervous system malformations was observed in one study; however, an increased risk of teratogenic events was not observed in other studies. Second and third trimester use of an ACE inhibitor is associated with oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios due to decreased fetal renal function may lead to fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters is also associated with anuria, hypotension, renal failure (reversible or irreversible), skull hypoplasia, and death in the fetus/neonate. Chronic maternal hypertension itself is also associated with adverse events in the fetus/infant. ACE inhibitors are not recommended during pregnancy to treat maternal hypertension or heart failure. Those who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for other medication options if an ACE inhibitor is currently prescribed or the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. The exposed fetus should be monitored for fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, and organ formation. Infants exposed to an ACE inhibitor",

"     INTRODUCTION",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Rheumatoid factors are antibodies directed against the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). The rheumatoid factor (RF), as initially described by Waaler and Rose in 1940 and as commonly measured in clinical practice, is an IgM RF, although other immunoglobulin types, including IgG and IgA, have been described.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Testing for RF is primarily used for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis; however, RF may also be present in other rheumatic diseases and chronic infections.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The origin of rheumatoid factors and the clinical utility of their measurement are reviewed here. Discussions of clinically useful biologic markers in rheumatoid arthritis, including rheumatoid factor, and of the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis are presented separately. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The origin of RF is incompletely understood [",

"     1,2",

"    ]. An abnormal immune response appears to select, via antigenic stimulation, high affinity RF from the host&rsquo;s natural antibody repertoire [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?41/41/42648/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This may occur in rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in a number of inflammatory diseases characterized by chronic antigen exposure, such as subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE). The development of RF after such infections has suggested that they represent an antibody response to antibodies that have reacted with microbes. This possibility is supported by experimental evidence showing that mice immunized with IgM-coated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) develop rheumatoid factors [",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Thus, the positive predictive value of RF testing is poor in a population with a low pre-test probability of RA, including those without inflammatory arthritis. Thus, testing patients with nonspecific arthralgia, fibromyalgia, or osteoarthritis is not recommended because a positive test result is likely to be a false-positive. In contrast, RF testing for patients with inflammatory arthritis (which is much less common than the noninflammatory conditions) has high positive predictive value and clinical utility.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The calculated negative predictive value of the RF (the likelihood of not having disease if the RF is negative) tends to be high in a population with a low pre-test probability of RA. However, a negative RF in this setting may not be particularly useful clinically. In our study, the negative predictive values for RA and for any rheumatic disease were 89 and 85 percent, respectively [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?41/41/42648/abstract/59\">",
"     59",
"    </a>",
"    ]. It is important to appreciate, however, that the value of a negative test depends upon the clinical setting. Suppose, for example, that a patient has an estimated 10 percent chance of RA; a negative RF test (assuming a sensitivity of 70 percent and specificity of 85 percent) will decrease the likelihood of RA from 10 percent to 4 percent. This small benefit may not justify performing the RF test.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The negative predictive value of RF in patients with a high pre-test likelihood of RA is limited by the relatively high frequency of seronegative RA. For example, if the pre-test probability is 50 percent and if the sensitivity is 70 percent, the post-test probability is 27 percent (ie, not low enough to feel confident that RA is not the diagnosis). In fact, patients with RF-negative RA (comprising 20 to 50 percent of RA) present in this fashion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The presence or absence of RF may have some value in predicting response to treatment. As an example, the anti-CD20 B cell depleting monoclonal antibody,",

There are, however, frequent exceptions to this rule, particularly among patients with one of the chronic inflammatory disorders noted above. Furthermore, the use of a higher titer for diagnosis decreases the sensitivity of the test as it simultaneously increases the specificity (by decreasing the incidence of false-positive results). In our study, for example, an RF titer of 1:40 or greater was 28 percent sensitive and 87 percent specific for RA; in comparison, a titer of 1:640 or greater increased the specificity to 99 percent (ie, almost no false-positive results) but reduced the sensitivity to 8 percent [",

"      There is no clear consensus regarding the indications for ordering the RF. The overall utility of this test may be historically overestimated, and the pre-test probability of RF-associated disease as well as confounding inflammatory disorders should be considered.",

"      The RF has a higher positive predictive value if ordered more selectively in patients with a modest or higher chance of having an RF-associated rheumatic disease such as RA, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, or the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. Included in this group are patients with prominent morning stiffness, with sicca symptoms, or with arthralgia or arthritis in a rheumatoid distribution (ie, symmetric polyarthritis involving small joints).

"     <li>",
"      The negative predictive value of RF is limited by the significant prevalence of RF-negative RA and by the low clinical utility of RF testing in patients with nonspecific arthralgia (since RF-associated rheumatic disease is relatively uncommon in that population). (See",

"      Although, in aggregate, seropositive disease and higher titers of RF are associated with more severe RA, measurement of RF has limited prognostic value in the individual patient with RA.
