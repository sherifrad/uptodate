"     Teduglutide is an analog of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), which is secreted in the distal intestine. Endogenous GLP-2 increases intestinal and portal blood flow while inhibiting gastric acid secretion and reducing gastric motility, thereby reducing intestinal losses and improving intestinal absorption. Teduglutide binds and activates GLP-2 receptors, resulting in release of mediators including insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, nitric oxide and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF).",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Hemodialysis patients are particularly vulnerable to contaminants in the water used to prepare concentrate and dialysate, or in water used for reprocessing dialyzers. Compared to healthy individuals, hemodialysis patients are exposed to extremely large volumes of water, have inadequate barriers to such toxins, and cannot easily eliminate contaminants:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The estimated water intake of a healthy individual is 2 liters per day or 14 liters per week. By comparison, a hemodialysis patient may be exposed to 350 to 500 liters of water per week, depending upon their treatment time and dialysate flow rate.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      With normal individuals, the gastrointestinal tract separates blood from contaminants in the water. By comparison, the barrier between blood and water in hemodialysis patients is a thin membrane, through which transfer of contaminants is limited only by the size of the contaminant.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      When dialyzers are reused, water is introduced into the blood compartment of the dialyzer during reprocessing. Contaminants in this water may be trapped in the blood compartment and the patient directly exposed to them during the next dialysis treatment.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Hemodialysis patients are unable to renally excrete any contaminants taken up from the dialysate.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Accumulated experience, combined with the observation that some of the most toxic contaminants arise from municipal water treatment practices, suggest that",
"    <strong>",
"     no",
"    </strong>",
"    municipal water can be considered safe for direct use in hemodialysis applications. All dialysis facilities therefore require a properly designed and maintained water treatment system to safeguard patients [",

"   <p>",
"    The methods of assuring that the water treatment system consistently provides suitable water for dialysis, including the maintenance and monitoring of the various water treatment devices, will be reviewed here. The different water-borne contaminants to which hemodialysis patients are exposed and the various water treatment systems available to the clinician are discussed separately. (See",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MAINTAINING WATER QUALITY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Maintenance of water quality begins with the proper installation and verification of the water treatment and distribution system according to pre-determined specifications and quality standards. Responsibility for installation verification is shared by the vendor of the system and the dialysis facility. However, once the water treatment and distribution system are installed and performance verified, responsibility for continued maintenance according to minimum quality standards rests solely with the hemodialysis facility.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The key to maintaining water quality is the establishment of a facility-specific quality management program for the water treatment and distribution system [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10775/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. That quality management program should detail maintenance practices, describe a structured monitoring program designed to verify satisfactory operation of the system, and identify the actions to be taken in the event that deviations from normal operation are observed. The quality management system should be fully documented with clearly delineated lines of responsibility; the medical director of the facility should provide regular oversight.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Appropriate maintenance practices should be provided by the vendor of a new system when it is installed or when an existing system is modified. It is the responsibility of the hemodialysis facility to ensure that those practices are made part of the quality management program and are properly implemented. Monitoring is intended to demonstrate that the maintenance practices ensure the delivery of high quality water and should be performed according to a pre-determined schedule. If monitoring suggests that the performance of the system, or of any individual system component, is inferior to specification, reassessment and, if necessary, modification of the system or of relevant maintenance practices should ensue. This process should be iterative and continue until monitoring demonstrates restoration of adequate performance.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although outside vendors are required for maintenance tasks including the replacement of deionizers and carbon beds, trained dialysis staff members should perform day-to-day maintenance and monitoring. Because failure of a water treatment system can lead to serious adverse events, the individuals responsible for day-to-day operation of the water treatment system should be well trained to recognize system failures and have the authority to act immediately based upon their findings. As an example, a technician who observes the exhaustion of a deionizer must be authorized to order the cessation of all dialysis treatments until the exhausted deionizer is replaced.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It is useful to include monitoring of the feed water in the quality management program since the ability of a water treatment system to continuously provide product water that meets the applicable standards may change in response to variations in quality of the water supply. The quality of many municipal water supplies fluctuates seasonally. In addition, changes in water treatment practices may lead to changes in water quality. As an example, in response to an Environmental Protection Agency requirement to decrease lead and copper concentrations in drinking water, many water suppliers in the United States have increased the pH of the water supply. This increase in pH may adversely affect the removal of chloramine by granular activated carbon. Thus, monitoring of feed water should include both direct measurement of contaminant levels and regular communication with the municipal water supplier.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Secondary disinfectants have been introduced to control Legionella in hospital water supplies. So far, the few available data suggest that existing water treatment systems are adequate to protect hemodialysis patients from one of these secondary disinfectants, chlorine dioxide [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10775/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, monitoring for chlorine dioxide and its daughter products, chlorate and chlorite, and additional carbon may be necessary when chlorine dioxide is present in the water supplied to a dialysis water treatment system. On the other hand, existing water treatment systems may not be effective in protecting patients from another secondary disinfectant,",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING GUIDELINES",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Maintenance practices for individual components of the water treatment system should be based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for use. Those practices may be modified as necessary based upon device performance. For example, the frequency with which it is necessary to clean reverse osmosis membranes depends on the quality of the feed water and is facility-specific.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Proper monitoring includes measurement of a variety of physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters; these data should then be charted to allow trend analysis of the performance of equipment and overall water quality. The primary purpose of monitoring is to assure that the system delivers high quality water.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In general, monitoring can be divided into two categories:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      On-line measurements of physical parameters, such as flow rate, pressure, conductivity, and temperature.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     On-line measurements",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Flow rate, pressure, and temperature are measured with standard gauges and meters and their outputs usually recorded manually. Conductivity (or resistivity) is used as a convenient on-line measure of the total concentration of ionized species in the water. All conductivity meters must be temperature-compensated.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Off-line measurements",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Levels of chemical and microbiologic contaminants are determined on samples of water collected at various places throughout the water treatment and distribution system. All sample ports should provide direct access to the stream to be sampled; they should not be placed in an area of stagnant flow, such as at the end of a long length of dead-end tubing. The water treatment system should also have been in continuous operation for at least 20 to 30 minutes before samples are obtained to ensure that the values reflect steady state operation of the system. Water should be allowed to flow from the sample port for about 30 seconds before samples intended for microbiological assays are collected.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Chemical contaminant assays",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The assay for each chemical contaminant must have a minimum detection level below the maximum allowable level for that contaminant. Most chemical contaminants can be determined off-site, well after sample collection, providing the sample container is clean and does not contribute contaminants to the sample. Chloramine is an exception to this rule. Since chloramine concentrations decrease with time, they must be determined immediately after sampling. Traditionally, the chloramine concentration was determined by measuring both the total chlorine concentration and the free chlorine concentration and calculating the difference. The current recommendation is to simply measure the total chlorine concentration and set the maximum allowable level at 0.1",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mg/L,",

"    the maximum allowable level for chloramine [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10775/abstract/2\">",

"    ]. This measurement can be made using a DPD (N.N-diethyl-o-phenylenediamine) assay or a \"dip and read\" test strip based on Michler&rsquo;s thioketone (MTK). The test method must have a minimum detection limit of less than 0.1",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     mg/L.",
"    </span>",
"    Because test strips can be sensitive to heat and humidity, careful attention should be paid to following the manufacturer's instructions for storage and use of test strips, including implementation of a quality control program if that is recommended. Alternatively, on-line monitors are available that allow chloramine to be monitored continuously.",

"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Samples should be collected into sterile, pyrogen-free containers and assayed within 30 minutes, or refrigerated and assayed within 24 hours. Samples transported to a remote laboratory for analysis should be packed in ice in an insulated container and shipped so that they arrive and are analyzed within 24 hours. Samples intended for bacterial cultures should not be allowed to freeze.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The choice of assay for bacteria is important. Commonly used clinical laboratory techniques are not suitable for detecting water borne organisms. The preferred assay methods are the membrane filtration, spread plate, or pour plate techniques. The use of commercially available water testers is not recommended. These devices are subject to errors in inoculation, incubation, and interpretation, particularly when used by untrained operators, and quality control is difficult when they are used in a dialysis facility.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    If the spread plate technique is used, the sample must not be applied with a calibrated loop. Calibrated loops are commonly used in clinical laboratories for culturing body fluids and apply a very small volume (typically 0.001 to 0.01 mL) to the culture plate. Since plates are generally not read as positive unless several colonies are observed, the minimum sensitivity of the calibrated loop technique is on the order of 1000 colony-forming units",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The choice of culture medium is also important. The medium must be low in nutrients and suitable for growing fastidious water borne organisms. Blood agars must not be used since they are too rich in nutrients for growth of organisms adapted to the nutrient-poor environment of purified water. Until 2011, the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard specified use of tryptic soy agar (TSA) in combination with incubation at 35 to 37&deg;C for 48 hours [",

"   </p>",

"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    When the product water flow rate or percent recovery of product water changes by some predetermined amount, typically 10 percent, at constant temperature, pressure and feed water flow rate, the membrane modules should be cleaned using the manufacturer's recommended method. An increase in pressure drop of 10 percent should also prompt cleaning of the membranes. If cleaning fails to restore performance, the membrane modules might need to be replaced. The life of reverse osmosis membranes can be prolonged by pretreatment of the feed water. As an example, softening the feed water will help minimize fouling with calcium and magnesium salts.

"    .) Although carbon can remove a wide range of organic contaminants by adsorption, removal of chloramine takes place via an oxidation&ndash;reduction reaction at active sites on the carbon surface. With time, access to these active sites is diminished by adsorption of soluble organic molecules and by trapping of suspended material present in the water. Finally, chloramine molecules reach the outlet of the bed without finding an active site. This phenomenon is known as breakthrough.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Patients are protected from exposure to chloramine resulting from breakthrough by placing two carbon beds in series and monitoring the chloramine concentration after the first bed. When exchangeable carbon beds are used, the first bed is discarded when breakthrough is detected, the second bed is moved into the first position, and a new bed is installed in the second position. When permanent carbon beds are used, it is often simpler to replace the carbon in both beds.",

"   <p>",
"    Monitoring the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of a carbon bed provides information on fouling (an increase in pressure drop at a constant flow rate) or channeling (a decrease in pressure drop at a constant flow rate). Fouling of a carbon bed occurs when suspended matter in the water is trapped in the bed by depth filtration. This trapped material increases the resistance to flow through the bed, and reduces the feed pressure to the next element in the purification cascade. Channeling occurs when the packing of carbon particles in a bed becomes non-uniform. Under such conditions, open passages form in the bed. Water passes through these channels, decreasing contact between the water and the carbon particles, and thereby reducing the ability of the bed to remove contaminants. If either condition is detected, back-flushing may prolong bed life. However, back-flushing does not regenerate exhausted bed capacity.",

Frequency of monitoring should be based upon the consequences of failure of a given purification process and the accumulated history of the performance of the water treatment and distribution system. As an example, since exhaustion of a deionizer may acutely expose patients to high concentrations of contaminants, deionizers must be monitored continuously and the monitor must be connected to appropriate safety systems. Similarly, if the feed water contains chloramine, carbon beds must be monitored at least daily because of the risk of acute hemolysis if patients are exposed to chloramine.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Parameters that are measured continuously on-line should also be recorded daily; these include the water production rate, the percent rejection and product water recovery of a reverse osmosis unit, and pressures throughout the water treatment and distribution system.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The final determinant of the adequacy of any water treatment and distribution system is the composition of the final product water and whether or not it meets the requirements of all applicable standards. The concentrations of chemical contaminants in the final product water should be determined when systems are newly installed or modified as part of installation verification. Analysis for chemical contaminants might also be necessary when changes in supply water or component performance, such as a decrease in reverse osmosis rejection rate, are detected. In the latter cases, it may be sufficient to analyze for a single contaminant, such as aluminum, rather than for all contaminants (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64883 \" href=\"UTD.htm?39/3/39995\">",
"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). The observation that parameters measured on-line remain stable over time provides some additional assurance that water quality is being maintained independent of the measurement of concentrations of individual contaminants. However, a complete analysis of all contaminants should be performed at least annually.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Bacteria are very difficult to remove once they have colonized a water distribution system, particularly if they form a mature biofilm on the interior surfaces of the distribution system. To minimize biofilm formation, all water distribution systems should be disinfected on a regular basis using a schedule designed to limit bacterial proliferation, rather than to eliminate bacteria once proliferation has occurred.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Experience suggests that an approach based on regular, frequent disinfection helps limit biofilm formation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10775/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. With this strategy, levels of bacteria and endotoxin are monitored to validate the effectiveness of the disinfection procedure, not to indicate when disinfection should be performed. Samples for surveillance cultures and endotoxin testing should be collected before the system is disinfected, when the highest levels of contamination are likely to be present. When a new system is installed or the integrity of an existing system is broken, frequent disinfection and monitoring should be performed until consistently low levels of bacteria are observed. The frequency of disinfection and monitoring may be decreased if the accumulated data consistently show low levels of contamination; however, at least monthly disinfection and monitoring is recommended.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    With new systems, it is important to recognize that biofilm takes some time to form and mature. Therefore, little or no growth might be seen in fluid samples taken during the first month of operation even if no disinfection is performed. For that reason, caution should be exercised in extending the disinfection interval based on culture results obtained during the first few months of operation of a new system.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Traditionally, disinfection has been performed using chemicals, such as",

"    </span>",
"    Frequent disinfection can be difficult with chemical agents because of the lengthy period of rinsing required to remove residual disinfection from a distribution system. Disinfection with hot water or ozonated water is increasingly seen as a preferable alternative since these methods leave no chemical residues (hot water) or residues with a short half-life (ozone).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In cases where biofilm has formed and is resistant to disinfection, cleaning the system with 2 to 3 percent citric acid before disinfection may help in biofilm removal, in the setting in which the materials of the system are compatible with exposure to the acid [",

"      Even a well functioning water treatment system might not ensure consistently adequate water quality if the quality of the water supplied to the dialysis facility changes. Facilities should establish a relationship with their water supplier and consider regular testing of the water supply if fluctuations in the quality of the incoming water are likely to occur. Proper monitoring includes measurement of a variety of physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters; these data should then be charted to allow trend analysis of the performance of equipment and overall water quality. In general, monitoring can be divided into on-line measurements of physical parameters (such as flow rate, pressure, conductivity, and temperature) and off-line measurement of the concentrations of specific chemical and microbiological contaminants.

"      Monitoring should encompass measurement of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters that allow both water quality and equipment performance to be assessed.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis and the release of intracellular muscle constituents into the circulation. Creatine kinase (CK) levels are typically markedly elevated, and muscle pain and myoglobinuria may be present. The severity of illness ranges from asymptomatic elevations in serum muscle enzymes to life-threatening disease associated with extreme enzyme elevations, electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney injury.",

"   <p>",
"    The causes of rhabdomyolysis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis; the clinical features and diagnosis of acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis; the management of patients with rhabdomyolysis, including methods to prevent acute kidney injury and related metabolic complications; and the prevention and management of acute compartment syndrome are discussed in detail separately.

"      The most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are drugs and toxins, including lipid-lowering agents, alcohol, and cocaine. Trauma and overexertion are also relatively common causes. The majority of patients has more than one etiologic factor, and less than 10 percent has no identifiable cause. Rhabdomyolysis rarely occurs in association with an inflammatory myopathy. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The QT interval duration varies between leads on the standard electrocardiogram (ECG), Frank orthogonal leads, and body surface potential maps [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/1-6\">",
"     1-6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These interlead differences, called QT dispersion or QT range, were proposed as an index of the spatial dispersion of the ventricular recovery times [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This measurement was an attempt to distinguish between myocardium that is homogeneous from myocardium that displays inhomogeneity, which is accompanied by increased dispersion of the ventricular recovery times and prolongation of repolarization. In reality, QT dispersion is a crude and approximate measure of a general abnormality of repolarization [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/8\">",
"     8",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    QT dispersion was developed in an effort to improve on ECG measures used in clinical practice, including the QT interval and its heart rate-corrected value (QTc) and the description of the ST-T morphology, often using vague terms such as \"non-specific ST-T wave changes.\" However, there has been much concern about the validity of the concept and the methodology of the measurement. Despite ongoing controversy, there are a number of reasonable conclusions about the reliability and applicability of the technique [",

"     NORMAL VALUES AND LIMITATIONS OF QT DISPERSION",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Reported values of QT dispersion vary widely, ranging from 10 to 71 msec in normal subjects [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/8,10-13\">",
"     8,10-13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In a review of 8455 healthy control subjects of various ages, including healthy children, the mean QT dispersion values ranged from 10 to 71 msec (mean 33 msec; median 37 msec) (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75877 \" href=\"UTD.htm?36/59/37822\">",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. There is little or no sex difference in QT dispersion [",

"     14-16",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Age-related differences, if present, appear to be small (&lt;10 msec) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/13,17\">",
"     13,17",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Similar values have been noted in large studies and literature reviews that suggested that the upper normal limit of QT dispersion in normal and healthy subjects is 65 msec [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/10,18\">",
"     10,18",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In contrast, other reports claim that QT dispersion &gt;40 ms has a sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 57 percent, respectively, for predicting the inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia during an electrophysiology study [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/19\">",
"     19",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, in most of the studies with positive results, values for QT dispersion are well within the demonstrated measurement error of both manual and automatic methods. Another problem is that some prospective studies only provided data for the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) dispersion [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/20,21\">",
"     20,21",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    QT dispersion is increased in patients with heart disease compared to healthy subjects, and prospective studies have suggested that QT dispersion has prognostic value. However, there is a great degree of overlap between healthy subjects and cardiac patients, as well as between patients with and without adverse outcomes (",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/146\">",
"     146",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, in the scientific statement for prevention of torsades de pointes in hospital settings by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology published in 2010, QT dispersion is not even mentioned among the ECG parameters that could be useful for monitoring the risk of torsades de pointes [",

"   <p>",
"    Reasons for the discrepancy between changes in QT dispersion and the development of torsades de pointes are not clear. Experimental studies using arterially perfused ventricular wedge preparations have shown that the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes is closely related to enhancement of the normally existing transmural dispersion of repolarization rather than to prolongation of ventricular repolarization (ie, the QT interval) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/148-151\">",
"     148-151",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These studies have shown that the interval from the peak to the end of the T wave (Tpe = Tpeak - Tend) reflects transmural dispersion of repolarization [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?10/33/10778/abstract/152\">",
"     152",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, unlike QT dispersion, the use of the Tpe interval as a surface ECG index of dispersion of ventricular repolarization is supported by credible experimental evidence. (See",

"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    However, further research on the Tpe interval is necessary to clarify its physiological background, optimal methods of measurement (eg, in which and how many leads, etc) and clinical use. The magnitude of regional and transmural dispersion of repolarization in the beating heart under normal and abnormal conditions as opposed to the wedge preparations (which measure) are also not clear and are subject to an ongoing debate [",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The QT interval duration varies between leads on the standard electrocardiogram (ECG), Frank orthogonal leads, and body surface potential maps. The variation between the longest and shortest QT intervals is reported as QT dispersion. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H1\">",
"       'Introduction'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Reported normal values of QT dispersion vary widely, and there is a great degree of overlap between healthy subjects and cardiac patients, as well as between patients with and without adverse outcomes. The lack of a standardized normal range and the overlap in values between healthy patients and those with cardiac disease has significantly limited the utility of QT dispersion in the clinical setting. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H2\">",
"       'Normal values and limitations of QT dispersion'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Increased QT dispersion has been demonstrated in patients with a variety of cardiac diseases (eg, myocardial infarction, heart failure, long QT syndrome, etc), which is consistent with the concept that QT dispersion represents a general repolarization abnormality. However, given significant variability in QT dispersion within patients with a specific disorder, along with the marked overlap in values with healthy patients, the diagnostic and prognostic utility of QT dispersion for a specific cardiac disorder remains undetermined. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"       'QT dispersion in cardiac disease'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Only significantly abnormal values of QT dispersion (ie, &gt;100 msec) which are clearly outside the possible measurement error can be recommended for use as markers of generally abnormal repolarization. However, the likelihood of finding such extreme values in ECGs from patients with normal T wave morphology is uncertain, and it is unknown if QT dispersion will offer any additional information to the traditional description of the T wave. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"       'QT dispersion in cardiac disease'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      New parameters of ventricular repolarization have been developed, such as the Tpe interval, quantitative analysis of T wave morphology, and beat-to-beat QT interval variability. These parameters, which more directly reflect the electrophysiological substrate of ventricular arrhythmias, have better measurement properties, and seem to be better predictors of adverse clinical events than QT dispersion. (See",
