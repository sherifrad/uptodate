"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Often clinically indistinguishable.Features suggestive of a bacterial aetiology include fever &gt;39&deg;C (&gt;102.2&deg;F ), bloody diarrhoea, significant abdominal tenderness, and toxicity.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presence of faecal leukocytes.Three fresh stool samples should be collected on different days and sent for microscopical examination for culture. A positive stool culture confirms the diagnosis.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section1'>Protozoal gastroenteritis</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section1'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Protozoal parasites such as Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Dientamoeba fragilis are uncommon causes of gastroenteritis, but are more likely if diarrhoea lasts &gt;14 days and the child has been to an endemic area.The onset is usually insidious and the course is chronic.There may be multi-system involvement and weight loss.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Presence of ova, cysts, and parasites on stool microscopy. Three fresh stool samples should be collected on different days.</p>",

"<dt><a href='#Section2'>Food poisoning</a></dt>",
"<dd id='Section2'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Food poisoning results from ingestion of food containing preformed toxins produced by bacterial contaminants.Presenting symptoms include profuse vomiting and abdominal cramps. There is often a history of similar illness in those people who ate with the patient. Onset of symptoms within a few hours suggests staphylococcal food poisoning whereas onset between 24 and 48 hours suggests salmonellosis.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Stool specimen positive for culture or presence of specific toxin.</p>",

"<dd id='Section4'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> History of antibiotics such as clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and second- and third-generation cephalosporins in particular predispose to overgrowth of Clostridium difficile and development of pseudomembranous colitis.Affected patients often present with explosive watery diarrhoea, fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and tenesmus.",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Plain abdominal x-rays may show dilated loop of intestine, air-fluid levels, paucity of air in the right lower quadrant, and a soft mass in the right or mid abdomen.Abdominal ultrasonography may show a tubular mass ('sandwich' or 'pseudokidney' sign) in longitudinal views and a target appearance ('doughnut' sign) in transverse views.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> WBC shows leukocytosis and a differential count shows a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells.If doubt exists, the diagnosis can be confirmed by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, which may show an oedematous, distended, and non-compressible appendix.</p>",

"<dd id='Section7'>",
"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> The onset of the disease coincides with the introduction of gluten into the diet.Typically presents with diarrhoea, vomiting, irritability, wasting, abdominal distension, and failure to thrive.Stools are characteristically foul smelling, pale, loose, bulky, and frothy.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> The antitissue transglutaminase IgA antibody test is highly sensitive and specific.Proximal small bowel biopsy shows villous atrophy.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Small bowel series may show fistula, sinus tracts, and strictures.Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum may show inflammatory changes, ulcers, nodularity, and strictures.Biopsy of the involved bowel may show non-caseating granulomas.</p>",

"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Air-contrast barium enema may show mucosal ulcerations and granularity in the colon and a 'lead pipe colon'.Colonoscopy may show micro-ulcers, erythema, oedema, and friability of the mucosa.Biopsy of the involved bowel shows mucosal inflammation.</p>",
