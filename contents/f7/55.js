"      IMPETIGO OVERVIEW",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Impetigo is a contagious skin infection that usually affects children. It can develop if bacteria get into healthy skin or into minor cuts, scrapes, or any other small openings (such as those caused by bug bites). Other terms for impetigo are pyoderma and impetigo contagiosa.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Impetigo is usually caused by a bacterium called \"Staphylococcus aureus,\" a type of \"staph\" infection. Less commonly the infection is caused by another bacterium called streptococcus group A, or \"strep.\" (see",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_patient\" href=\"UTD.htm?22/4/22595?source=see_link\">",
"      \"Patient information: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Beyond the Basics)\"",
"     </a>",
"     ).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Impetigo is most common among children ages two to five years, but it can also affect older children and adults. The infection usually occurs in warm, humid conditions and is easily spread among people in close contact.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     More detailed information about impetigo is available by subscription. (See",

"      IMPETIGO SYMPTOMS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Impetigo causes red bumps on the skin, usually on the face, arms, or legs. These bumps eventually form blisters that then burst and scab over with a distinctive yellow, gold, or brown crust (",
"     <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59728 \" href=\"UTD.htm?6/9/6290\">",
"      picture 1",
"     </a>",
"     ). In some cases, the blisters become painful sores that slowly heal (",
"     <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72412 \" href=\"UTD.htm?1/3/1087\">",
"      picture 2",

"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      IMPETIGO DIAGNOSIS",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If you have impetigo, your doctor or nurse can usually diagnose the condition just by looking at the affected parts of your skin. In some cases, your doctor or nurse will take samples of pus from one of the blisters to confirm the presence of bacteria, but that is not usually necessary.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      IMPETIGO TREATMENT",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Depending on how severe and extensive your infection is, your doctor or nurse may recommend a topical cream or ointment or oral antibiotics.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If you have just a few affected spots that do not seem to penetrate deep into the skin, antibiotics in an ointment or cream may be all that is needed. On the other hand, if you have a larger infection, if the infection goes deep into the tissue, or if the areas are hard to reach, you may need antibiotics in pill form.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The antibiotic ointment experts recommend for impetigo is a prescription medicine, mupirocin (Bactroban&reg;). You must apply this medicine to the infected parts of your skin. Be sure to finish the entire course of treatment to be sure that the infection does not come back.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If you get antibiotics in pill form, you will probably have to take them for seven days or longer. Take all the antibiotics prescribed to you, even if your skin clears up before you complete the medicine.",

"      PREVENTING IMPETIGO",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Impetigo is typically spread from person to person through direct skin-to-skin contact. To keep from getting impetigo, the most important thing you can do is wash your hands with soap and water right after you touch anyone who has the infection. If you are not near a sink, an alcohol-based hand-rub will work, too.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     To prevent the spread of impetigo and of other infections, take the following precautions:",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Wash your hands with soap and water often (no matter whom you touch) and use alcohol hand rubs. Do not share personal items, such as towels, clothes, or hair combs. The germs that cause impetigo can live on these objects.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Wash towels and bed linens in hot water and dry them on high heat.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       If you have impetigo, try covering the parts of your skin that are infected. Otherwise, if you scratch the affected skin and then touch yourself elsewhere, you can spread the infection to other parts of your body. Plus, the bacteria will get on your hands and anything you touch.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Always use disposable tissue paper to blow your nose and teach your children to do the same. If you have impetigo on your nose or face, the germs that cause impetigo will wind up on the tissue. Also, wash your hands after handling tissues that could be carrying germs.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       When you sneeze, sneeze into the crook of your arm or into your shoulder, not into your hands. Otherwise the bacteria from your nose and mouth will end up on your hands and anything you touch.",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If you get impetigo over and over again, see a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in treating skin disorders). You might have another skin problem that is making it hard for your body to fight the infection.",

"    Electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram of mitral valve prolapse as heard at the apex. S1 (mitral and tricuspid valve closure) is followed by a mid systolic click resulting from the prolapse of the mitral valve. After the prolapse occurs, there is the mid systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation. With standing, there is a decrease in venous return, a decrease in left ventricular volume and the mitral valve prolapses earlier in systole. Consequently, the mitral regurgitation murmur is lengthened.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Postcoital bleeding refers to spotting or bleeding unrelated to menstruation that occurs during or after sexual intercourse. It can be a sign of serious underlying pathology and is usually alarming for patients. About one-third of patients also have abnormal uterine bleeding that is not associated with coitus and about 15 percent have dyspareunia [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/1,2\">",

"   <p>",
"    This topic will discuss causes of postcoital bleeding, the likelihood that cancer is the cause, and an approach to management. Other causes of abnormal uterine bleeding and evaluation of women with other types of abnormal uterine bleeding can be found separately. (See",

"     PREVALENCE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Postcoital bleeding, while uncommon, is not rare in community populations. The point prevalence determined in large community surveys using self-completed questionnaires ranges from 0.7 to 9 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/3,4\">",
"     3,4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. One study reported an annual cumulative incidence of about 6 percent of menstruating women [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Another reported a prevalence of 5 percent among patients being seen in a hospital's obstetrics and gynecology outpatient department [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These disparities are due to variations in study design, including differences in symptom definition, time range in which the symptom occurred (past month to six months), frequency (ever versus frequently), age distribution of the population, and prevalence of sexually transmitted infection and use of hormones. In addition, some studies included women not having sexual relations in the study population.",

"     Cancer",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The most serious cause of postcoital bleeding is cervical cancer. About 11 percent of women with cervical cancer present with postcoital bleeding (range 0.7 to 39 percent) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/7\">",
"     7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The proportion of women with cervical cancer who present with bleeding has fallen over time, probably due to widespread use of screening programs that identify premalignant and malignant cervical disease. It is generally felt that premalignant disease is asymptomatic [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/8,9\">",
"     8,9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, adenocarcinoma accounts for an increasing proportion of cervical cancer cases and may be less likely to cause postcoital bleeding than squamous cancer since the lesion may be high in the endocervical canal and protected from trauma during coitus [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/3,8\">",
"     3,8",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    When calculating risk, it is important to remember that the positive predictive value (PPV, the proportion of individuals with the symptom who have or develop the disease) is dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied and to whom it is applied. In a community population, a Finnish study in the 1960s and 1970s calculated 1 in 220 women with postcoital bleeding had cervical cancer [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8054/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Since that time, there has been a change in the frequency of the symptom and incidence of the disease. More contemporary calculations estimate the risk of cervical cancer in women with postcoital bleeding to be 1 in 44,000 women age 20 to 24 years, 1 in 5600 women age 25 to 34 years, 1 in 2800 women age 35 to 44 years, and 1 in 2400 in women aged 45 to 54 years [",

"      Cervical polypectomy is performed for polyps that are symptomatic (eg, bleeding, excessive discharge), large (&ge;3 cm), or appear atypical.

"    Unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) is diagnosed in patients who have suffered at least one major depressive episode and have no history of mania, mixed mania, or hypomania [",

A major depressive episode is a two week or longer period with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of unipolar major depression are discussed further. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Maintenance treatment is indicated for unipolar psychotic depression because patients who remit are at high risk of suffering another episode of major depression, with or without psychotic features [",

"     1,7,8",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8055/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, there is little high quality evidence to guide decisions about maintenance treatment.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Pharmacotherapy is generally used for maintenance treatment of unipolar psychotic depression. Acutely ill patients who remit with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic are usually maintained on the same combination at the same dose for at least four months (at which point it may be feasible to discontinue the antipsychotic while maintaining the antidepressant). However, it may be necessary to lower doses or switch the antidepressant",

"    Patients with unipolar psychotic depression who remit with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are generally started on an",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",

"    </span>",
"    combination. The combination is started the day after ECT is completed, unless the patient is suffering cognitive impairment secondary to ECT, in which case maintenance pharmacotherapy is delayed until the impairment has dissipated. Choosing a combination is discussed separately. (See",

"     Duration and discontinuation",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;During maintenance treatment of unipolar psychotic depression with combination pharmacotherapy, the antidepressant is generally maintained longer than the antipsychotic. Most authorities discontinue the antipsychotic after four months of sustained recovery from the episode of unipolar psychotic depression, and continue the antidepressant [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8055/abstract/9-11\">",
"     9-11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. If the patient has side effects (eg, tardive dyskinesia with a first generation antipsychotic or weight gain with a second generation antipsychotic) and is clinically stable, it is reasonable to taper the antipsychotic sooner than four months. Conversely, for patients who relapsed while discontinuing the antipsychotic during maintenance treatment of prior episodes of psychotic depression, it is reasonable to maintain the antipsychotic for at least 6 to 12 months.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    We suggest slowly tapering the antipsychotic over one month to increase the probability of detecting incipient depressive and psychotic symptoms before a full-blown episode of psychotic depression recurs. Each week we taper by approximately 25 percent of the dose used to achieve remission. As an example,",

"    If symptoms recur during the taper, the dose is usually titrated back up to the full dose used initially to achieve remission. If a full-blown episode develops despite increasing the dose and does not improve within four to eight weeks, we suggest switching to an alternative antipsychotic. Switching drugs is discussed separately. (See",

"    For patients with unipolar psychotic depression who successfully taper and discontinue the antipsychotic, but subsequently relapse during maintenance treatment with antidepressant monotherapy, we suggest restarting the antipsychotic that was discontinued. The relapse is treated as a new acute episode; acute treatment is discussed separately. (See",

"      hallucinations. A major depressive episode is a two week or longer period with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in most activities, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide.

"      Unipolar major depression with psychotic features is a highly recurrent illness. For patients with unipolar psychotic depression that remits, we suggest initial maintenance treatment with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic rather than antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy (",

"       Grade 2C",
"      </a>",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Fibromyalgia is a common cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is one of a group of soft tissue pain disorders that affect muscles and soft tissues such as tendons and ligaments. None of these conditions is associated with tissue inflammation and the etiology of the pain is not known.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Fibromyalgia, like other functional somatic syndromes, has been a controversial illness [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Patients look well, there are no obvious abnormalities on physical examination, and laboratory and radiologic studies are normal. Thus, the role of organic illness has been questioned, and fibromyalgia has often been considered to be psychogenic or psychosomatic. Current pathophysiologic concepts focus on alterations in central nervous system pain processing.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia will be reviewed here. The possible pathogenic mechanisms, differential diagnosis of widespread pain, and treatment of fibromyalgia, as well as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia in children and adolescents, are discussed separately.

"     PREVALENCE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Fibromyalgia, initially termed fibrositis, was described in France and England in the mid-nineteenth century. By the end of the twentieth century, many rheumatologists recognized fibromyalgia as a discrete syndrome. Diagnostic classification criteria were proposed, evaluated, and then validated. Using such criteria, fibromyalgia is now considered to be the most common cause of generalized, musculoskeletal pain in women between ages of 20 and 55 years; in the United States and in other countries, the prevalence is approximately 2 percent and increases with age [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/1-4\">",
"     1-4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. As an example, one report found a prevalence of 1.6 percent in France [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Fibromyalgia is six times more common in females in reports from specialty clinics, although the female predominance is not as striking in the community [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/6,7\">",
"     6,7",
"    </a>",
"    ]. More than 40 percent of patients referred to a tertiary pain clinic meet the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia [",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Physical examination reveals tenderness in multiple soft tissue anatomic locations. Laboratory testing is normal in the absence of other illnesses (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60339 \" href=\"UTD.htm?10/1/10267\">",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Symptoms",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The cardinal manifestation of fibromyalgia is widespread musculoskeletal pain, involving both sides of the body and above and below the waist. However, the pain may initially be localized, often in the neck and shoulders. Common patient descriptions include \"I feel as if I hurt all over\", or \"it feels as if I always have the flu.\" Patients typically describe pain predominantly throughout the muscles, but often state that their joints hurt, and sometimes describe joint swelling, although synovitis is not present on examination [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/10,11\">",
"     10,11",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Patients also often report paresthesias, including numbness, tingling, burning, or creeping or crawling sensations, especially in both arms and both legs. However, unless a concurrent neurologic disorder, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or a cervical radiculopathy, is present, a detailed neurologic evaluation or formal testing is usually unremarkable.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The other universal symptom of FM is fatigue. This is especially notable when arising from sleep, but is also marked in the mid-afternoon. Seemingly minor activities aggravate the pain and fatigue, although prolonged inactivity also heightens symptoms. Patients are stiff in the morning and feel unrefreshed, even if they have slept 8 to 10 hours. Patients with FM characteristically sleep \"lightly\", waking frequently during the early morning and have difficulty getting back to sleep. A common quote is \"No matter how much sleep I get, it feels like a truck ran me over in the morning\".",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Cognitive and mood disturbances are present in the majority of patients. The cognitive disturbances are often referred to as \"fibro fog\". Patients typically describe problems with attention and difficulty doing tasks that require rapid thought changes. Neuropsychological testing reveals abnormalities that are somewhat different than those found in mood disturbances [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/12\">",

"     1-3",

"    ]. In a Canadian general population sample of 127,000, those 1635 subjects with fibromyalgia were three times more likely to have depression compared with subjects without fibromyalgia [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Twenty-two percent of the fibromyalgia group had concurrent major depression. Depression in that group correlated with younger age, female gender, unmarried status, food insecurity, number of chronic conditions, and limitations in activities. Two-fifths of those with depression and fibromyalgia had not discussed mental health concerns with any health professionals in the previous year.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Headaches are present in more than 50 percent and include migraine and muscular (tension) types [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In an ambulatory tertiary headache clinic, fibromyalgia was present in 174 of 889 patients (20 percent), including 44 percent of those with chronic, tension-type headaches [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Fibromyalgia comorbidity correlated with frequency of headaches, anxiety, pericranial tenderness, poor sleep, and physical disability.",

"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). The tender point examination requires that the examiner knows where to palpate and how much pressure to apply.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The nine pairs of tender points used for the 1990 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (see below) are at locations that most primary care physicians and specialists routinely evaluate in patients with soft tissue complaints. These locations include the upper mid-trapezius muscle, the lateral epicondyle (the so-called tennis elbow location), the second costochondral junction (the site of costochondritis), and the greater trochanter (the site of trochanteric bursitis of the hip). The amount of pressure should equal 4",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     kg/cm2,",
"    </span>",
"    which is enough to whiten the nail bed of the examiner's finger tip.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    We advise that when evaluating the tenderness of the nine pairs of specific fibromyalgia points that so-called control locations, such as over the thumb, the mid forearm or the forehead, also be palpated in a similar fashion, Fibromyalgia patients are typically not as tender in these control areas. A joint examination should always be done, looking for any synovitis and also palpating for tenderness over the joints themselves.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A complete physical examination, with a careful joint and neurologic examination, is necessary to exclude other illness presenting with similar symptoms. The neurologic evaluation may sometimes reveal minor sensory and motor abnormalities, in the absence of another condition [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/21\">",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DIAGNOSIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based primarily on the patient's symptoms of widespread pain. Patients report chronic myalgias and arthralgias, but have no evidence of joint or muscle inflammation on physical examination or laboratory testing. The physical examination reveals multiple tender points at soft tissue locations (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \" href=\"UTD.htm?28/31/29170\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). However, fibromyalgia can be diagnosed without a specific number of tender points (see below).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There is no diagnostic laboratory test, or radiographic or pathologic finding, and testing should be kept to a minimum (see below). The diagnostic evaluation is usually straightforward and should never be a \"fishing\" expedition to exclude every potential cause of pain and fatigue (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63893 \" href=\"UTD.htm?20/61/21467\">",

"     22",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Fibromyalgia should be initially considered in any patient complaining that &ldquo;I hurt all over&rdquo; or &ldquo;It feels like I always have the flu&rdquo; (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63893 \" href=\"UTD.htm?20/61/21467\">",
"     table 2",
"    </a>",
"    ). Often, subspecialty referral is more cost-effective than ordering multiple laboratory and imaging studies.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Fibromyalgia, like headache or irritable bowel syndrome, will continue to be a controversial diagnosis because of a lack of objective changes. Nevertheless, at least 10 percent of the general population has chronic widespread pain, and the majority of these individuals do not have any specific disease or structural abnormality to account for the pain. Many such individuals have symptoms and findings compatible with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There has also been controversy regarding the utility of the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Although some have argued that providing a diagnostic label to everyday symptoms increases illness behavior, there are now more studies suggesting that patients improve after a diagnosis and there is significant saving of health care dollars [",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      We obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or a C-reactive protein (CRP), for initial laboratory evaluation. Since fibromyalgia is not an inflammatory condition, normal acute phase reactants immediately provide confidence that an occult inflammatory disorder is unlikely.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Serologic tests, such as antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor, should be obtained only if the history and physical examination suggest an inflammatory, systemic rheumatic disease.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In an attempt to provide some homogeneity in patient populations in clinical studies, various classification criteria for fibromyalgia have been developed and tested. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification Criteria for Fibromyalgia were published in 1990 and have been used in most clinical and therapeutic trials [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/26\">",
"     26",
"    </a>",
"    ]. They are less useful for diagnosing FM in routine clinical practice.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The ACR criteria were based upon expert rheumatologists' opinions regarding the optimal historical and physical findings that could differentiate patients with fibromyalgia from those with other rheumatic diseases and forms of chronic pain. These criteria were then field tested in a number of academic rheumatology clinics and office practices.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The final 1990 ACR FM classification criteria included:",

"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",

"      Symptoms of widespread pain, occurring both above and below the waist and affecting both the right and left sides of the body",

"      Physical findings of at least 11 of 18 tender points",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These simple criteria had greater than 85 percent sensitivity and specificity for differentiating patients with fibromyalgia from those with other rheumatic diseases.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In office practice, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be made even if fewer than 11 of 18 tender points are present, provided that the history is consistent with FM and that the major differential diagnoses have been excluded. The tender points represent heightened pain perception rather than sites of inflammation or tissue pathology. Thus, they are proxies for pain, and the exact number necessary to diagnose fibromyalgia clinically is somewhat arbitrary. It is important to recognize that the classification criteria were validated for large patient populations and should be used primarily in clinical research and epidemiologic studies of fibromyalgia.",

"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Some investigators have advocated not using the tender point examination as part of the FM diagnostic criteria and relying only on symptoms [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/27,28\">",
"     27,28",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This approach recognizes that most clinicians have not been trained in the technique for performing a tender point examination. Indeed, most rheumatologists make a diagnosis without a tender point examination. Furthermore, the tender points do not accurately reflect the underlying central pain pathophysiology involved in this disorder.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    These considerations were important in developing the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary diagnostic criteria for FM (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81631 \" href=\"UTD.htm?26/19/26941\">",
"     table 3",
"    </a>",
"    ). These criteria provide an alternative approach to diagnosis, which does not require a tender point examination, but does provide a scale for measurement of the severity of symptoms that are characteristic of FM [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/27\">",
"     27",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These criteria were designed with the recognition that in practice, tender point counts are often not obtained, and the increased appreciation of the importance of cognitive problems and somatic symptoms in patients with FM that were not considered in the 1990 ACR classification criteria. The preliminary diagnostic criteria showed good correlation with the 1990 ACR criteria.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The preliminary diagnostic criteria that do not include a tender point examination may also help address concerns regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis by nonspecialists [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/29\">",
"     29",
"    </a>",
"    ]. These criteria may be particularly useful for clinicians who are inexperienced in performing tender point examinations or as additional data points in difficult cases. However, the criteria require additional validation in different patient populations (eg, primary care settings and patients with other rheumatic diseases). Since they can be self-administered, these new criteria will be more practical for population-based studies of chronic widespread pain.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The preliminary criteria may be used in patients with symptoms present at a similar level for at least three months, and no other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. They combine a widespread pain index (WPI) and a symptom severity (SS) scale for making the diagnosis of FM (",

"     table 3",
"    </a>",
"    ). The WPI is a measure of the number of painful body regions from a defined list of 19 areas. The SS score includes an estimate of the degree of fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms; and the number of somatic symptoms in general. The SS can also be used for the assessment of patients with current or previous fibromyalgia or for longitudinal evaluation. A simple modification of the criteria allows them to be used in epidemiologic and clinical studies without an examiner [",

However, the history and physical examination, as well as limited laboratory testing, are usually sufficient to differentiate FM from other conditions, such as systemic inflammatory arthropathies, spondyloarthropathy, autoimmune connective tissue disorders, polymyalgia rheumatica or myopathy (",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Since FM is not uncommon in patients with rheumatic or systemic illness, it may be difficult to determine whether a patient's symptoms are related to that associated illness or to FM. This is especially important in inflammatory rheumatic disorders, but FM may also coexist with noninflammatory musculoskeletal conditions and a number of functional somatic syndromes.",

"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;It is important to distinguish symptoms of FM from those of chronic rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), because of the different implications for treatment. For example, FM should be considered as the cause of diffuse pain and fatigue in a patient with RA lacking active synovitis and elevated acute phase reactants, rather than escalating or reinstituting antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy for RA. There is also evidence that RA disease activity scores, such as the DAS28, can be overestimated in patients with coexisting FM [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8056/abstract/31\">",
"     31",

"     32",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Multiple, inter-correlated factors including social disadvantage, psychological distress, comorbidity, RA severity, and fibromyalgia variables correlated with the development of fibromyalgia.

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Patients with FM may end up with multiple diagnoses according to subspecialty referral patterns, if the clinicians caring for the patient are diagnostic \"splitters\", On the other hand, the exact label may be less important, if these functional illnesses are considered as part of a spectrum. For example, various studies have reported that 30 to 70 percent of patients with FM meet criteria for CFS and IBS [",

"     GENERAL APPROACH",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The preferred venous access site during pediatric resuscitation is the largest, most accessible vein that does not require the interruption of resuscitation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Intraosseous cannulation is an acceptable alternative as a first attempt at vascular access in a child with full cardiopulmonary arrest or severe shock. (See",

"      Peripheral venous access should be attempted before attempting other forms of vascular access if peripheral veins can be readily seen or palpated.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Attempts at peripheral and central venous access in the head, neck, and chest should be limited during CPR to avoid interruption of ventilation and chest compressions.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      During CPR or the treatment of severe shock, intraosseous cannulation and peripheral venous access should be pursued simultaneously [",

"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The use of a protocol can facilitate the rapid establishment of venous access [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In one study, for example, a protocol was designed to limit the time spent in futile attempts to achieve peripheral and central venous catheterization [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In this study, rapid sequential attempts at percutaneous femoral vein catheterization, saphenous vein cutdown, and intraosseous cannulation were initiated if initial peripheral IV insertion failed after 90 seconds. Utilization of all techniques, according to protocol, significantly improved IV access time. Resuscitations in compliance with the protocol achieved IV access more rapidly than did those deviating from the protocol (median, 4.5 versus 10 minutes) when initial percutaneous peripheral IV attempts failed. Intraosseous cannulation had a high degree of success when other measures failed.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Peripheral vs central",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Studies in adult animal resuscitation models suggest that central venous drug administration produces more rapid onset of action and higher peak drug levels than does peripheral venous administration [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/7,8\">",
"     7,8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, the superiority of central drug administration has not been demonstrated in pediatric animal arrest models [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In pediatric animal and human resuscitation studies, peripheral venous, central venous, and intraosseous drug administration result in comparable onset of drug action and peak drug levels when the resuscitative drug is followed by a bolus of several mLs of normal saline [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Based upon these studies, we suggest that less emphasis be placed on achieving central venous access in initial resuscitative efforts. However, central venous access is preferred for high volume resuscitation and reliable infusion of irritant drugs. In addition, each resuscitative drug administered should be followed by a bolus of at least 5 to 10 mL of normal saline, regardless of the vascular route obtained [",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PERIPHERAL ACCESS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Peripheral venous catheters are the easiest and safest means of achieving vascular access. Modern catheters for peripheral venous access are of smaller caliber, are more flexible, are more resistant to bacterial colonization, are less thrombogenic, and are longer-functioning than those of the past [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/11\">",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Catheter selection",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The most common type of peripheral venous catheter used in children is the over-the needle-catheter, which usually is 22 to 24 gauge in newborns and infants and 18 to 20 gauge for older children. The size of the cannula used in resuscitation should be the largest that can be inserted reliably. In shock or severe hypovolemia, a smaller cannula may be used for initial fluid resuscitation until a larger vein can be cannulated. Butterfly needles should be avoided because they infiltrate easily.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Sites",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Potential sites include the upper and lower extremities, the scalp, and the external jugular vein. Depending on the length and the position of the catheter tip, external jugular venous cannulation also may provide central venous access.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\">",
"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Upper extremity",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The cephalic, basilic, and median cubital veins in the forearm and the dorsal veins of the hand offer a route for rapid drug and fluid delivery in the upper extremity (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50832 \" href=\"UTD.htm?5/24/5519\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). However, these sites may be difficult to locate in a well-nourished infant. Transillumination of the palm with a high powered cold light source has been successfully used in infants and young children to locate veins for cannulation in the dorsum of the hand [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/12\">",
"     12",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      The access site most commonly employed in children is the dorsum of the hand [",

"       13",
"      </a>",
"      ].",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The median antecubital vein is another site that is relatively easy to cannulate, but it must be well secured with an armboard because flexing the elbow can lead to kinking of the catheter and extravasation of the fluid.",

"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\">",
"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Lower extremity",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The great saphenous vein at the ankle is the most accessible vein in the lower extremity because of its large size and consistent anatomy. The veins of the dorsal arch also can be used (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70790 \" href=\"UTD.htm?33/20/34127\">",

"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Scalp",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The small superficial veins of the scalp rarely are useful during CPR, but may be helpful in less urgent situations. This location is less desirable because the scalp may have to be shaved to expose the vein, and doing so may cause the parents unnecessary concern about a \"needle in the head\" [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A circumferential tourniquet, such as a rubber band, is placed around the forehead to make the veins visible (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75153 \" href=\"UTD.htm?14/1/14352\">",
"     figure 3",
"    </a>",
"    ). Boluses of fluid may be given via a scalp IV in an attempt to improve circulating volume, making other peripheral venous sites more visible and accessible. Caution must be used when accessing scalp veins because the temporal artery or its branches can be cannulated inadvertently. Cannulation of an artery is indicated by blanching of the proximal scalp when the saline flush is introduced [",

"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     External jugular",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The external jugular vein is another useful site for vascular access in young children because no adjacent arterial or neural structures are present. However, it cannot be used as a primary site during resuscitation of infants or children with airway compromise or respiratory failure because cannulation of the external jugular vein requires extension and rotation of the neck.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Cannulation of the external jugular vein usually requires that the infant or child be placed in a 30 degree head-down (Trendelenburg) position (",

"     figure 4",
"    </a>",
"    ). The right external jugular vein is preferred for access. Cannulation of this vessel is difficult because of its tendency to roll. In addition, external jugular catheters are easily dislodged and difficult to immobilize, particularly in infants [",

"     <li>",
"      Step 1 &ndash; The extremity to be used is immobilized. The vein is located and stretched. If the antecubital fossa vein is to be cannulated, a soft roll of gauze can be placed behind the elbow to hyperextend it. If the dorsal hand veins are to be cannulated, the hand is held firmly with the wrist flexed. If the dorsal foot veins are to be cannulated, the foot is held firmly with the ankle extended.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 2 &ndash; A tourniquet is applied proximal to the vein, and the skin over the vein is cleansed with an antiseptic solution.",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 4 &ndash; The skin is punctured slightly distal or lateral to the site of the proposed venipuncture site by using an 18 or 20 gauge needle to facilitate entry of the catheter through the skin. The skin is pulled to the side before puncture, punctured without entering the vein, and then released. Utilizing steps 3 and 4 will increase the likelihood of a successful peripheral venous cannulation but can be omitted in an emergency.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Complications",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The complication rate associated with peripheral venous catheters is relatively low, and severe complications are infrequent. Complications include hematoma formation, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, thrombosis, phlebitis, pulmonary thromboembolism, infiltration, and skin slough [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/13,15\">",
"     13,15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Medications that are irritating to the veins, such as calcium, dopamine, or epinephrine, should be diluted and administered through the largest peripheral vein possible to avoid the development of phlebitis.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CENTRAL ACCESS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Central venous catheters are a reliable means for administering large volumes of fluids or potentially irritating solutions. Infiltration rarely occurs when drugs are infused by this route [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, central venous catheters can be used to collect blood samples and monitor hemodynamic variables, such as central venous pressure or mixed venous hemoglobin-oxygen saturation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Finally, careful attention to technique and verification of catheter tip placement are necessary to avoid complications. Ultrasound-guidance should be used for placing femoral vein or internal jugular venous catheters whenever the equipment and operator experience is available. (See",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Catheter selection",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;When selecting a catheter for central venous access, one should recognize that the flow rate through a catheter is directly proportional to the internal diameter of the catheter and inversely proportional to its length. In addition, the resistance to flow decreases by the fourth power of the change in the radius as the radius of the catheter increases [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/14\">",
"     14",

"     table 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). For short-term access during a pediatric resuscitation, single-, double-, or triple-lumen polyethylene catheters are used most frequently. Polyethylene catheters are not suitable for long-term access because they have a higher rate of infection and thrombosis than do silastic central venous catheters [",

"     figure 5",

"    ).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The femoral vein is the site used most frequently by pediatric emergency physicians because it is relatively easy to access, is distant from the major sites of activity during resuscitation, and is associated with a lower rate of complications than are other sites (3.7 versus 7.3 percent) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/16\">",
"     16",
"    </a>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, it should not be cannulated in patients who have possible interruption of the inferior vena cava (eg, trauma, abdominal catastrophe) [",

"   <p>",
"    Subclavian vein and internal jugular vein cannulation should be performed only by individuals specifically trained in the procedure because the complication rate is significant when cannulation is attempted by inexperienced personnel [",

Once free flow of blood is achieved using the small needle or catheter, a guidewire is threaded through the needle or catheter into the vessel, and the small-gauge needle or catheter is withdrawn over the guidewire while the guidewire is held in place.

"     <li>",
"      Step 5 &ndash; A 2 cm incision is made perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia (",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 6 &ndash; The subcutaneous tissue is dissected bluntly using a curved hemostat, proximal to distal, paralleling the course of the vein. The hemostat is passed with the tips up to the bone. The tips are spread, and the hemostat is gently raised from the incision site, which should lift up the saphenous vein. Care should be taken to separate the vein from the surrounding tissues because a sensory nerve is located just anterior to the vein (",

"      ).",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 7 &ndash; A small silk suture is placed around the distal end of the vein once the vein is isolated. Then it is anchored distally with a clamp (",

"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 8 &ndash; A second silk suture is placed around the proximal end of the vein but is left untied.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 9 &ndash; A scalpel blade is used to incise the vein while applying gentle traction to the distal tie. This step is accomplished best by inserting the sharp point of the scalpel perpendicular to the long axis of the vein into the upper third of the vessel to produce a vein wall flap halfway through the vein (",
"      <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51805 \" href=\"UTD.htm?0/61/982\">",
"       figure 12",
"      </a>",
"      ).",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 10 &ndash; The catheter is threaded into the venotomy site. The insertion of the catheter is facilitated by using a small hook to hold up the proximal vein flap [",
"      <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8057/abstract/20\">",
"       20",
"      </a>",
"      ]. The hook can be made by bending the tip of a 22 gauge needle with a hemostat (",

"       figure 12",
"      </a>",
"      ). Alternatively, the exposed vein can be catheterized directly with a traditional over-the-needle catheter. This procedure can be performed without tying off the distal end of the vein. The technique is similar to that used for percutaneous venipuncture except that in saphenous venous cut-down, the vein is directly visualized.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 11 &ndash; The catheter is advanced into the vein. Running intravenous fluids, while simultaneously advancing the catheter, dilate the vein and may facilitate passage of the catheter (",

"      ).",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 12 &ndash; The proximal silk suture is tied around the cannulated vein to hold the catheter in place. The catheter is sutured in place.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Step 13 &ndash; The incision site is sutured, and a sterile occlusive dressing is applied (",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The major hemoglobin in adults is hemoglobin A, which is a tetramer consisting of two pairs of globin polypeptide chains: one pair of alpha chains; and one pair of beta chains. In normal subjects, globin chain synthesis is very tightly controlled so that the ratio of production of alpha to non-alpha chains is 1.00 &plusmn; 0.05. There are two copies of the alpha globin gene on chromosome 16. A single beta globin gene resides on chromosome 11 adjacent to genes encoding the beta-like globin chains, delta and gamma (",

"     \"Structure and function of normal human hemoglobins\"",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Thalassemia refers to a spectrum of diseases characterized by reduced or absent production of one or more globin chains. Beta thalassemia is due to impaired production of beta globin chains, which leads to a relative excess of alpha globin chains. These excess alpha globin chains are unstable, incapable of forming soluble tetramers on their own, and precipitate within the cell, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations. The degree of alpha globin chain excess determines the severity of subsequent clinical manifestations, which are profound in patients homozygous for impaired beta globin synthesis and much less pronounced in heterozygotes who generally have minimal or mild anemia and no symptoms. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?37/13/38106?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Alpha thalassemia, in comparison, is due to impaired production of alpha globin chains, which leads to a relative excess of beta globin chains. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?35/11/36025?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia\"",
"    </a>",
"    .) The toxicity of the excess beta globin chains in alpha thalassemia on the red cell membrane skeleton appears to be less than that of the excess partially oxidized alpha globin chains in beta thalassemia [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8058/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. This probably explains why the clinical manifestations are generally less severe in alpha compared with beta thalassemia of comparable genetic severity (except for homozygous alpha (0) thalassemia, which is incompatible with extrauterine life, leading to hydrops fetalis",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",

"    death shortly after delivery).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The pathophysiology of the anemia in beta thalassemia will be reviewed here. This discussion will focus on the mechanisms by which unbalanced alpha globin chain synthesis leads to hemolysis of red cells in the peripheral circulation and, more importantly, to the extensive destruction of erythroid precursors within the bone marrow and in extramedullary sites, such as the liver and spleen (ineffective erythropoiesis). The molecular pathology of the thalassemias is discussed separately. (See",

"     Beta (0) thalassemia",

"    <strong>",
"     absence",
"    </strong>",
"    of production of beta globin. Patients homozygous or doubly heterozygous for beta (0) thalassemic genes cannot make normal beta chains and thus are unable to make any hemoglobin A.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Beta thalassemia major",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Beta thalassemia major is the term applied to patients who have either no effective production (as in homozygous beta (0) thalassemia) or severely limited production of beta globin. These are the patients originally described by Cooley (Cooley's anemia). Starting during the first year of life, they have profound and life-long transfusion-dependent anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal deformities due to bone marrow expansion; they are prone to infection and skeletal fractures and, unless appropriately treated, die during adolescence of iron overload syndromes.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Beta thalassemia minor, also called beta thalassemia trait, is the term applied to heterozygotes who have inherited a single gene leading to reduced beta globin production. Such patients are asymptomatic, may be only mildly anemic, and are usually discovered when a blood count has been obtained for other reasons.",

Such patients may have the skeletal abnormalities and hepatosplenomegaly seen in thalassemia major. However, their hemoglobin concentrations usually range from 5 to 10",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     g/dL",
"    </span>",
"    and they usually require transfusions only when they have an intercurrent event, such as an infection, which impairs erythropoiesis. Their clinical symptoms may not be apparent until well after the first year of life.",

"     Anemia",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Anemia in beta thalassemia is generally caused by the presence of two interrelated phenomena: death of red blood cell (RBC) precursors within the bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis, also called intramedullary hemolysis) and increased destruction of circulating RBCs (hemolytic anemia). Each of these phenomena will be described separately, although both are ultimately attributable to unbalanced globin chain synthesis.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thalassemic RBCs offer innate protection against severe malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?7/55/8058/abstract/3,4\">",
"     3,4",

If, as suggested by the evidence cited above, the major problem in beta thalassemia is accumulation of excess unmatched alpha globin chains, then patients with beta (0) thalassemia should be clinically worse than patients with beta (+) thalassemia, and there is a general trend in this direction [",

"     84,85",

"    ]. Similarly, coinheritance of alpha thalassemia and homozygosity for a beta thalassemic chromosome with Xmn1 cleavage site at position -158 of the G gamma globin gene, which is associated with somewhat higher levels of Hb F, should (and does) lessen the severity of the disease [",

Red cells from these patients show evidence of oxidative stress (eg, elevated values of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and methemoglobin), reduced serum concentrations of vitamins E and C, and also show loss of phospholipid membrane asymmetry [",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The preceding observations are testaments to our understanding, or lack of understanding, of the pathophysiology of beta thalassemia and its variants. It has been difficult to pinpoint some of the critical pathophysiologic events in human beta thalassemia because of the complex genetic and environmental background of these patients. As an example, many patients inherit complex combinations of beta thalassemia along with hemoglobinopathies (such as Hb E) and alpha thalassemia. In addition, patients in countries where beta thalassemia is prevalent may be exposed to malaria and other infectious agents that can contribute to the anemia [",

"     SUMMARY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Beta thalassemia is an inherited disorder due to impaired production of beta globin chains. This leads to a profound excess of highly unstable alpha globin chains in patients homozygous for impaired beta globin chain production. The following abnormalities in red cell precursors and circulating red cells follow from such accumulations of excess alpha chains:",

"    Summary of five studies in hemodialysis (HD) and three studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) showing a direct relation between dialysis delivery (as estimated from Kt/V) and protein catabolic rate (PCR). These curves can also be used to estimate how much dialysis is required to achieve a desired level of PCR. The weekly Kt/V divided by three is used to compare the Kt/V with CAPD with the per treatment value for three times weekly hemodialysis.",
