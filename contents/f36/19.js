"     ritonavir",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Strategies to simplify HIV therapy are driven by concerns of long-term toxicities of chronic combination ART (eg, lipodystrophy, cardiovascular complications), cost, and the risk of drug resistance over time with non-adherence.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Trials of induction-maintenance therapy were unsuccessful in the 1990s, although the failure of this early approach may have been related to drugs with a low genetic barrier to resistance together with insufficient bioavailability [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37173/abstract/1,2\">",
"     1,2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, the introduction of boosted protease inhibitors led to much improved pharmacokinetics, raising hopes that regimen simplification may be feasible. Advantages of such an approach would include fewer adverse events, fewer drug-drug interactions, lower cost, and preservation of other treatment options [",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Nevertheless, with the availability of easy-to-administer and combination formulations of antiretroviral agents that are generally well tolerated, the rationale for using boosted protease inhibitors as monotherapy is less compelling than when more toxic drugs were commonly used.",

However, a comparable treatment failure rate was noted in the subgroup of patients who had attained viral suppression for at least six months prior to switching to monotherapy compared to those who continued combination ART (ie, 23 versus 18 percent with viral breakthrough). Similarly, although the overall 12-month treatment failure rate was 38 percent in an observational study of 529 HIV-infected patients who were switched to protease inhibitor monotherapy after achieving virological suppression on at least six months of combination ART, those who had maintained viral suppression for at least a year before the switch had a lower subsequent failure rate [",

"      In an effort to reduce costs and adverse effects from long-term drug exposure, there has been interest in studies of simpler treatment or maintenance regimens with boosted protease inhibitors. (See",

"      Monotherapy with boosted lopinavir for treatment-naive HIV-infected patients is associated with lower rates of viral suppression and the emergence of PI-associated mutations and is not recommended. (See",

"       'Initial therapy'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The use of boosted PIs as \"maintenance treatment\" is also been less effective than combination therapies in achieving complete virologic suppression and is not recommended by any of the major HIV treatment guideline committees. (See",

"      above.)",
"     </li>",

"      In light of easy-to-administer formulations of nucleoside analogs that are generally well tolerated, the rationale for using boosted protease inhibitors as monotherapy is less compelling than when more toxic NRTIs such as",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Blood transfusions traditionally have been administered either in hospitals or outpatient clinics. In an effort to increase the accessibility and convenience of care to chronically ill patients and decrease associated costs, many therapies, including transfusions, are now occasionally given in patients' homes or physicians' offices. The indications for home blood transfusion are similar to those in other healthcare settings. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?20/37/21081?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Use of red blood cells for transfusion\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There is one major factor that distinguishes the administration of blood in a home setting from transfusion in a hospital: the decreased availability of emergency medical care in the event of a serious complication. This inherent difference compounds the already present and usual risks of transfusion; thus, increased convenience and decreased costs must be subsumed to patient safety.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The key aspects of home transfusion, with the focus on recipient safety, will be reviewed here. The discussion will begin by directing the reader to resources and references that should be consulted before ordering blood for home administration. The standardized procedures to maximize the safety of home blood transfusion are presented separately. (See",

"     WHOM TO CONSULT AND WHY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Activities related to the collection, processing, issuing, and transfusion of blood and blood components are regulated by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or individual states, and numerous standards applicable to these processes have been promulgated by organizations such as the AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks), College of American Pathologists (CAP), and The Joint Commission. It is prudent for physicians wishing to order home transfusions to be familiar with applicable standards and regulations. It is unlikely that a blood center or hospital transfusion service would issue blood to a healthcare provider or agency that does not have transfusion procedures in place that meet regulations and industry standards.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The foundation of the transfusion safety and regulatory infrastructure consists of detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for every aspect of the transfusion process, from ordering blood, to collecting the pre-transfusion compatibility testing specimen, storing and transporting components, infusing, and, finally, properly discarding the disposables and empty blood bag. Documentation, retention of records, staff training and periodic competency assessment are also required elements.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Resources pertaining to transfusion regulations and practice are usually accessible. The medical directors of community blood centers and hospital-based transfusion services are often specialists trained in transfusion medicine who are well informed about pertinent regulations. The AABB promulgates standards [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Although the FDA does not regulate the clinical practice of Transfusion Medicine, it exercises regulatory oversight of blood collection, processing, quality assurance, and relevant current Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMPs) through the publication of the Code of Federal Regulations [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ] and various guidance documents. There is also substantial peer-reviewed home transfusion literature [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/4-7\">",
"     4-7",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     GENERAL APPROACH",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The most common model for delivering transfusion services to a patient's home involves an arrangement between a home health agency (HHA) that transfuses the blood and a community blood center (CBC) or hospital transfusion service (HTS) that provides the blood components [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    After blood is ordered, the HHA transfusionist (usually a licensed nurse) visits the patient's residence, collects and labels blood specimens for pre-transfusion testing, and puts an identification band on the patient. During the pre-transfusion and transfusion visits, patient identification, which should involve ensuring correctness of band information and also asking the patient to state",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     his/her",
"    </span>",
"    name and birth date (or another numeric identifier) is critical for patient safety, since it connects the specimens, the blood that is transfused, and the patient. It would not be imprudent to ask the patient to confirm",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     his/her",
"    </span>",
"    identity and key information such as date of birth by showing a government-issued or other official form of identification.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    At the time of this initial visit, the home should be assessed for its proximity to a hospital or urgent care facility. If the home is in a remote site in which access to critical care could be unnecessarily delayed, consideration should be given to transfusing the patient in an outpatient facility. The actual transfusion location within the home should be evaluated for easy access to emergency personnel if it becomes necessary to urgently obtain these services.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The preliminary visit allows the transfusionist to affirm that the patient's physical and mental status are appropriate for home transfusion, and that a cell phone or land line and another responsible adult are available in the home. These are necessary so that help can be summoned quickly if a serious transfusion reaction occurs.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Pre-transfusion specimens are delivered to the CBC or HTS where",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     ABO/Rh",
"    </span>",
"    typing, antibody screening, and compatibility testing are performed. The components are packed for shipping according to specific federal and other regulatory guidelines, and taken, usually by the transfusionist, to the patient's home. During this visit, the nurse obtains informed consent (if not done previously), begins an intravenous infusion of physiologic saline, and transfuses the blood. The nurse remains with the patient during the entire transfusion and for at least 30 minutes following the infusion in order to monitor for late-appearing sequelae. The empty blood bag and disposables are returned to the issuer for proper disposal.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Another model for home transfusion involves the direct provision of home services by the HTS or CBC, without an intermediary organization such as a HHA. In this approach, the transfusionists are employees of the hospital or blood center.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PHYSICIAN ROLE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Transfusion outside the hospital setting offers physicians a unique patient care opportunity, but one that by its novel nature may require more personal involvement than hospital-based transfusion. Because patient safety potentially could be compromised by the inaccessibility of comprehensive emergency care, physicians must anticipate and plan for off-site management of acute transfusion-related medical emergencies in the patient's home.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Physician preparedness involves availability to and knowledge about transfusing personnel. Many HHAs require that the physician be notified just prior to infusion, and that the physician be available at all times during blood administration. The physician must be familiar with each agency's procedures for recognizing and managing acute reactions, and may, in fact, want to participate in developing such procedures. The doctor should also decide what pharmacologic agents the transfusionist should have on hand for treating complications. Examples are anti-pyretics, anti-histamines to treat minor allergic reactions, and epinephrine in case an anaphylactic reaction occurs. Physicians should know that the competence and experience level of the transfusionist are commensurate with the risk of out-of-hospital transfusion.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATIENT PROFILE",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Home or office transfusion is most appropriate for patients with chronic diseases in whom symptoms can be temporarily remedied by receiving blood. Illnesses accompanied or characterized by thrombocytopenia or anemia fall into this category. An annual review of home transfusions by one community blood center showed that more than 60 percent of red blood cell products were administered to patients with malignancies, HIV-related conditions, or nonspecified anemias [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Less common indications were hemoglobinopathies, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The prospective recipient must be medically stable. Patients with compromised cardiac or pulmonary function or who have other serious conditions should be transfused in a hospital or outpatient facility.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Home or office transfusion is an appropriately used service if patients have physical or emotional impediments to leaving their homes or traveling, but should not be offered merely for the sake of convenience. Patients must be alert and oriented so that they can give informed consent and communicate symptoms of a possible reaction. Some children are candidates for home transfusion [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ], but need to be mature enough to demonstrate an understanding of the process and be able to communicate symptoms that could be related to the transfusion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Finally, patients who are possible candidates for home transfusion should have a history of previous transfusion without severe or repeated reactions. Although this has been the subject of debate, it is an AABB patient selection criterion that should be considered when making home transfusion decisions.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     COMPONENTS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;For the sake of this discussion, components are defined as those products derived from a unit of whole blood that have not undergone further manufacturing, or those derived from apheresis collection procedures, such as plateletpheresis products. Red blood cells (RBCs), single or pooled platelet concentrates or apheresis platelets, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and granulocytes are included, whereas products such as albumin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and clotting factor concentrates are not. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?11/39/11895?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Preparation of blood components\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Components can be ordered from community blood centers or hospital transfusion services that have an established arrangement with a specific physician's office or home health agency. The components most commonly transfused in a non-hospital setting are red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Some issuing facilities place reasonable limits on the number of units released for a given transfusion event. If RBCs or FFP are ordered, no more than two units of each are issued; if platelets are required, up to eight pooled concentrates or one plateletapheresis (single donor) product are issued. The justification for these volume limits revolves around intravascular volume considerations and the questionable appropriateness of out-of-hospital transfusion for patients requiring higher doses.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Cryoprecipitate could be appropriately transfused in a nontraditional setting if a patient has a specific clotting factor deficiency for which a factor concentrate is not available. However, with the growing array of pharmaceutically manufactured clotting factors, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that cryoprecipitate would be transfused in an out-of-hospital setting for this indication. Patients requiring granulocyte transfusions are almost always severely neutropenic and septic, and thus too ill to be transfused any place other than a hospital. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?9/33/9752?source=see_link\">",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Special considerations",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;To avoid the possible occurrence of febrile, non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs), some issuing facilities recommend that all cellular products (RBCs and platelets) undergo leukofiltration to decrease the number of leukocytes transfused. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?11/31/11769?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Immunologic blood transfusion reactions\"",
"    </a>",
"    .) Some facilities issue RBC units that have undergone leukoreduction soon after blood collection; such \"prestorage\" leukoreduction decreases the opportunity during storage for white cells to elaborate cytokines responsible for FNHTRs [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/10,11\">",
"     10,11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?24/5/24665?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion\"",
"    </a>",
"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    If leukoreduced products are not available, bedside filtration is another, although not optimal, alternative. The disadvantage of doing leukofiltration at the bedside is the increased chance of a FNHTR occurring due to higher concentrations of cytokines, which are not removed by the filters.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    If the patient needs platelets, single donor (apheresis) platelets are preferable because fewer allogeneic exposures occur. Most leukocytes are automatically removed during apheresis, and bedside filtration would not be necessary. In addition, apheresis platelets are tested for bacterial contamination on highly sensitive, automated culture systems.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MANAGEMENT OF REACTIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Literature dealing with home transfusion complications is limited, but suggests that complications are infrequent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37174/abstract/12-16\">",
"     12-16",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The reasons for this are not known, but careful pre-selection of eligible patients could play a role.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The ability to minimize a patient's morbidity and mortality due to a transfusion reaction primarily resides in the transfusionist's ability to quickly recognize, diagnose, and treat reactions. The absence of on-site physician staff, equipment, and resources normally available in a hospital potentially pose significant safety hazards for a patient. For this reason, only transfusionists who have been trained and are experienced in transfusion therapy should be permitted to transfuse in non-hospital settings. Further, the attending physician must be immediately available by telephone during the transfusion.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Reactions are usually identified by the subjective reporting of symptoms by the patient, objective observations by the nurse of a change in the physical condition of the patient, or changes in the patient's vital signs. The patient's temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate should be taken prior to the transfusion; at least every 15 minutes during the first 45 minutes of the transfusion and, if stable, every 30 minutes thereafter or more frequently; at the conclusion of the transfusion; and 15 or 30 minutes after the transfusion has ended.",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Minor transfusion complications",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are not life-threatening. However, they must be distinguished from hemolytic reactions because chills and a temperature increase are seen in both. When these symptoms appear, the transfusion must be discontinued, and the attending physician and blood bank called. Blood specimens should be collected in the type of tube required by the facility that will be performing assays for evidence of hemolysis. The transfusionist should make arrangements for delivery of the specimens to the blood center, but should not leave the patient until the attending physician deems it safe to do so.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Blood bank staff should be able to contact the physician immediately if there is evidence of hemolysis, and the patient should be transported to an emergency care facility.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Allergic reactions, characterized by urticaria and hives, are managed by discontinuing the infusion and notifying the attending physician. If there is no evidence that the patient is having an anaphylactic reaction (also sometimes initially characterized by urticaria and pruritus), the physician may decide to resume the transfusion after the patient is medicated with, and has completely responded to, antihistamines.",

Once the sudden onset of fever, rigors, severe changes in systolic blood pressure, flushing, or other symptoms is recognized by the nurse, measures to support the blood pressure and arrange for emergency transport to a hospital must be undertaken.

In the EBD group, the median duration of ERCP markedly increased for stone diameters over 9 mm; in the EST group this increase was observed only when stone diameters exceeded 15 mm. Thus, the difference in time required for ERCP between EBD and EST was most pronounced for patients with stone diameters between 10 and 15 mm. In these patients, EBD usually required additional lithotripsy, whereas EST usually permitted stone extraction without prior lithotripsy. For patients with stones &lt;10 mm in diameter, stone removal after EBD required about five minutes more than EST.",

"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) of the biliary sphincter can be a valuable adjunct to the therapeutic arsenal of the biliary endoscopist for removal of bile duct stones during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in highly selected patients. EBD permits effective stone removal with a success rate similar to that of endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), the standard treatment for bile duct stones.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      In our opinion, EST should remain the standard procedure for removal of bile duct stones. This is not because the results of EBD are disappointing, but because many of the arguments that led to interest in EBD (mainly concern related to complications from EST) have been put into better perspective. Prospective studies have shown that EST for bile duct stones is much safer than was once believed. The most important complication of endoscopic stone removal is pancreatitis, the one complication for which EBD may carry an increased risk. (See",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?38/49/39705?source=see_link\">",
"       \"Overview of indications for and complications of ERCP and endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy\"",
"      </a>",
"      .)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Concern related to long-term complications after EST was another consideration that spurred interest in EBD since EBD preserves the biliary sphincter. EST results in a permanent loss of sphincter function leading to chronic duodenobiliary reflux with bacterial colonization and low-grade inflammation of the biliary system. However, the clinical consequences of these events remain unclear since long-term follow-up studies have not revealed any severe late complications.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      We still consider EBD to be a reasonable option in young patients (&lt;40) with small stones who do not have additional risk factors for pancreatitis. Generally accepted risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis include younger age, female sex, pancreas divisum, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, prior ERCP-induced pancreatitis, difficulty of cannulation, precut sphincterotomy, pancreatic duct injection, sphincter of Oddi manometry, and a small common bile duct (&lt;5 mm), particularly in the setting of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. (See",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?27/63/28666?source=see_link\">",
"       \"Post-ERCP pancreatitis\"",
"      </a>",
"      .) Stones in such patients can be removed easily without lithotripsy while preserving sphincter function. As noted in this review, however, there are no data available to substantiate this policy.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      We also consider EBD in settings where EST is more dangerous or difficult, such as in patients with risk factors for post-sphincterotomy bleeding and those who have undergone a Billroth-II gastrectomy. (See",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?25/38/26216?source=see_link\">",
"       \"Post-ERCP bleeding\"",
"      </a>",
"      and",
"      <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?5/18/5415?source=see_link\">",
"       \"ERCP after Billroth II reconstruction\"",
"      </a>",
"      .) This may also hold true for the occasional patient with a periampullary diverticulum where the position of the papilla prohibits a safe sphincterotomy. Although no series are available on its use in this situation, EBD may be a safe and easy alternative to EST.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The vast majority of patients with bile duct stones do not fall in one of the small subgroups outlined above. EST, therefore, remains the cornerstone of the endoscopic management of bile duct stone. EBD is a technique that should be reserved for special indications only.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Candidiasis refers to the range of infections caused by species of the fungal genus Candida; these infections can be acute or chronic, localized or systemic. Disseminated candidiasis is life-threatening. The great majority of candidiasis is caused by Candida albicans. C. albicans is a common commensal organism in the oropharyngeal cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina of humans but is capable of causing opportunistic infection following disruption of the normal flora, a breach of the mucocutaneous barrier, or a defect in host cellular immunity. C. albicans can be detected as normal flora in about 50 percent of individuals [",

"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The genus Candida encompasses more than 350 species. They can be found among humans and other mammals, birds, insects, arthropods, fish, animal waste, plants, mushrooms, naturally occurring high-sugar substrates (eg, honey, nectar, grapes) and fermentation products, dairy products, soil, freshwater, seawater, and on airborne particles [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/2-4\">",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Infection in humans was first described as oral thrush by Hippocrates in the fifth century BC. In 1853, Charles Robin microscopically observed budding cells and filaments in epithelial scrapings, and he named the fungus Oidium albicans. Subsequently, more than 160 synonyms, including Monilia albicans, were used before Candida albicans became the accepted name for this species.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    At least 13 Candida species have caused infection in humans. The most common of these are C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis. C. parapsilosis has been recognized as a heterogeneous species, and it was proposed that it be split into three morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable species: C. parapsilosis, C. metapsilosis, and C. orthopsilosis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Phylogenetic analyses show that C. glabrata is more closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae than to the Candida albicans group [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/6,7\">",
"     6,7",
"    </a>",
"    ], and a taxonomic revision is possible.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In 1995, Candida dubliniensis was described as a new species to accommodate a subset of isolates previously identified as C. albicans [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. C. dubliniensis is seen primarily among HIV-positive people [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/9\">",
"     9",
"    </a>",
"    ]. An environmental source for this species may be the digestive tract of marine birds [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. There is no clear clinical or experimental evidence that significant pathogenicity differences exist between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/10\">",
"     10",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    All of these clinically common species are diploid, except for the haploid C. glabrata. Of the aforementioned species, only C. krusei has been determined to have a classic sexual cycle [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/11\">",
"     11",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, mating and genetic recombination does occur in C. albicans through a parasexual cycle involving tetraploidy [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/12,13\">",
"     12,13",
"    </a>",
"    ]. An apparently similar mating mechanism exists in C. dubliniensis, and interspecific mating occurs between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/14\">",
"     14",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Sequencing of the Candida albicans genome has demonstrated that this species possesses 6354 genes contained in 8 chromosomes. These data will facilitate proteomic studies, which in turn could lead to better understanding of key biological characteristics of these species, including pathogen-host interactions, improved diagnostics, antifungal drug resistance, novel molecular targets for antifungal therapy, biofilm formation and dynamics, cell signaling, and responses to stress, nutrients, temperature, and pH [",

"     Growth, morphology, and pleomorphism",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Unlike the so-called systemic dimorphic fungi (eg, Histoplasma capsulatum), the morphology of a given Candida species is fundamentally the same whether observed in vitro or in vivo. C. glabrata grows as a small, elliptical, unicellular budding yeast at all times (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61641 \" href=\"UTD.htm?27/21/27987\">",
"     picture 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). Rarely, buds of C. glabrata can adhere to one another in rudimentary short chains. In marked contrast, C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis form elliptical budding cells that typically are larger than those of C. glabrata; they can also form elaborate and well developed multicellular filaments (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53369 \" href=\"UTD.htm?12/25/12689\">",
"     picture 2",
"    </a>",
"    ), particularly when in contact with a solid substrate, such as human tissue or agar culture media.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    C. krusei and C. parapsilosis can be considered dimorphic because they exhibit budding and pseudohyphal forms. C. albicans and C. tropicalis can form true hyphae (in addition to buds and pseudohyphae) and thus can be considered pleomorphic. Each of these species is capable of exhibiting budding",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    filamentous morphologies in infected tissue.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Usually, the presence of budding yeast and filaments in infected tissue is indicative of candidiasis. However, similar morphologies occur in infections caused by certain opportunistic molds (eg, Paecilomyces lilacinus). Histologic misdiagnosis of these mold infections as candidiasis can occur if histology is the sole diagnostic criterion used [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/16-18\">",
"     16-18",

"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Pseudohyphae and hyphae",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pseudohyphae are morphologically and ontogenically distinct from hyphae. They are formed when buds remain attached to each other and subsequently elongate via differential rates of wall synthesis at various points along the cell wall. Elongation then stops and each terminal cell produces a new apical bud, which elongates in turn. This repeated process of budding and elongation can result in extensive filamentation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/19\">",
"     19",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Side branches initiate as buds, and develop in the same manner. A constriction typically remains and can be seen at the origin of each bud (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80723 \" href=\"UTD.htm?5/13/5329\">",
"     picture 3",
"    </a>",
"    ). The branching process is regulated in part by a vacuolar protein [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/20\">",
"     20",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In contrast, true hyphae elongate by a polarized growth process of apical synthesis that does not involve budding. Buds are not present at the hyphal tips; as a result, true hyphae do not exhibit the periodic constrictions that characterize pseudohyphae (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76924 \" href=\"UTD.htm?42/21/43358\">",
"     picture 4",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/21\">",
"     21",
"    </a>",
"    ]. C. albicans hyphae have been shown to contain the Spitzenkorper, a vesicle-laden, actin-rich structure, well known in molds, that correlates with tip growth rate and direction [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/22\">",
"     22",
"    </a>",

"    <span class=\"h3\">",
"     Septa",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Septa form by centripetal synthesis from the interior of the cell wall inward toward the center of the cell and are present in pseudohyphae, hyphae, and between mature bud cells [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/21\">",
"     21",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The septa provide internal support of the tubular filaments, and a central pore in each septum assures cytoplasmic continuity between cells [",

"     White-opaque switching",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In addition to yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms, C. albicans exhibits two additional phenotypes: white and opaque colonies. Although genetically identical, the two phases differ in virulence and gene expression, and switching between phenotypes occurs at a known frequency although the extent to which environmental (including host) stimuli control switching is not fully known [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/23\">",
"     23",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Opaque phase cells are prevalent as skin colonizers and are more readily killed by neutrophils, whereas white phase cells are more commonly associated with candidemia and are less susceptible to neutrophil defenses [",

"     Genetic control",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Signals that trigger each of the growth forms gradually are becoming better understood. Signals include pH, temperature, carbon and nitrogen availability, oxygenation, serum, hormones, and density of the Candida cells within the infected host [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/25-28\">",
"     25-28",
"    </a>",
"    ]. For example, one of the key factors, as indicated by studies of C. albicans, is pH of the microenvironment [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/29,30\">",
"     29,30",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Several pH-regulated genes involved in growth and morphology have been identified: PHR1 is expressed when the ambient pH is 5.5 or higher, and correlates with filamentous growth, whereas PHR2 is expressed when the ambient pH is lower than 5.5 (as in the vagina), and correlates with yeast-like growth [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/29\">",
"     29",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Thus, the importance of these genes might vary according to the site of infection. For example, a null mutant of PHR1 was avirulent in a mouse model of systemic infection (the systemic pH being well above 5.5) but maintained its ability to produce vaginal infection (where the pH is approximately 4.5). Conversely, a PHR2 null mutant was able to cause systemic but not vaginal infection. Mutants without Phr1p, a protein product of the PHR1 gene, also lack cross-linking activity associated with the cell wall glucan when grown at pH 8 [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/31\">",
"     31",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Adaptation of C. albicans to the neutral-alkaline environment of the human body by pH sensing is determined mainly by the RIM 101 signal transduction pathway [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37176/abstract/32\">",
"     32",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Several other genes have been identified which regulate the switch from the budding yeast to the filamentous form. Double mutants of EFG1 and CPH1 were nonfilamentous (ie, locked in the yeast form) and unable to form hyphae or pseudohyphae in response to stimuli, such as serum and macrophages [",

"      Candida species have little inherent virulence as illustrated by their ability to exist in a commensal relationship with humans and other animals. Nevertheless, several virulence factors have been identified, including the ambient pH of the host, calcineurin, and various adherence mechanisms. (See",

Other genetic mutations have also been associated with mucocutaneous Candida infections in familial clusters. (See",

"      Cell wall constituents in Candida species can evoke both humoral and cellular host immune responses during the course of infection. In addition, extracellular proteinases of C. albicans trigger immune responses locally and systemically. The cell-mediated immune response is clearly important in the host defense against Candida, as reflected by the higher prevalence of infections among individuals whose cellular immune systems are impaired.

A small increased risk of preterm birth has been associated with maternal use of protease inhibitor-based combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapy during pregnancy; however, the benefits of use generally outweigh this risk and  protease inhibitors (PIs) should not be withheld if otherwise recommended. Hyperglycemia, new onset of diabetes mellitus, or diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported with PIs; it is not clear if pregnancy increases this risk.",

"     Regardless of CD4 count or HIV RNA copy number, all HIV-infected pregnant women should receive a combination antepartum ARV drug regimen; this includes women who require therapy for their own health, as well as women who do not yet require therapy for their own health. ARV therapy should be started as soon as possible if required for the woman&rsquo;s health. Although earlier initiation may be more effective in reducing the perinatal transmission of HIV, also consider maternal conditions (eg, nausea and vomiting) and the potential risks of first trimester fetal exposure for specific agents. Plasma HIV RNA levels should be assessed at ~34-36 weeks gestation in order to help determine mode of delivery. If ARV therapy must be interrupted for &lt;24 hours during the peripartum period, stop then restart all medications simultaneously in order to decrease the chance of developing resistance. Long-term follow-up is recommended for all infants exposed to ARV medications.",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Changes in mineral metabolism and bone structure develop early in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsen with progressive loss of kidney function. Chronic kidney disease-metabolic bone disease (CKD-MBD) includes abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or vitamin D; abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength;",

"    </a>",
"    ]. The more severe forms of CKD-MBD (renal osteodystrophy) occur in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. These include hyperparathyroid-mediated high-turnover bone disease or osteitis fibrosa cystica, adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Patients with chronic kidney disease may have other bone diseases (osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency) either before or after developing kidney disease. Osteoporosis is a common disease that is characterized by low bone mass with microarchitectural disruption and skeletal fragility, resulting in an increased risk of fracture, particularly at the spine, hip, wrist, humerus, and pelvis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/2\">",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It is difficult to diagnose osteoporosis in the setting of CKD. This is particularly relevant for the aging population, where fragility fractures, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and low bone mineral density (BMD) are more prevalent. There are multiple reasons why this differentiation is important, not the least of which is that management of osteoporosis versus the spectrum of bone diseases in patients with CKD differ vastly.",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/1\">",
"     1",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;In 2008, a World Health Organization (WHO) task force introduced a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), which estimates the 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical spine, proximal humerus, or forearm) for untreated patients between ages 40 and 90 years using easily obtainable clinical risk factors for fracture (",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    FRAX does not include any adjustment of risk according to GFR. Although GFR (usually estimated GFR [eGFR]) was measured in some of the nine population studies used to construct the FRAX model, the sample size was not statistically powerful enough to validate the independent contribution of reduced GFR on fracture risk. However, in clinical practice, FRAX may be applied to patients with CKD. Just as one may need to incorporate falls or frequency of falls (which were also not captured in FRAX) into a clinical judgment when utilizing FRAX, the clinician should also consider adjusting the absolute fracture risk to a higher level (approximately double) in patients with eGFR stages G3b to G5 (",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is routinely used to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fractures in the general population. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"UTD.htm?41/37/42583?source=see_link\">",
"     \"Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry\"",

"    .) In cross-sectional studies, BMD by DXA has also been shown to be lower in patients with predialysis CKD who fracture compared with those who do not [",

"     19-21",
"    </a>",
"    ]. For every standard deviation decrease in lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and ultradistal radius BMD by DXA, there was a significant increase in the risk of fracture (ORs 1.93, 1.65, 1.86, and 2.29, respectively) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/20\">",
"     20",
"    </a>",
"    ]. BMD is also lower in dialysis-dependent patients who fracture, as illustrated by the findings of a meta-analysis of six cross-sectional studies which included 683 patients on dialysis [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/22\">",
"     22",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Compared with patients without fracture, patients with fracture had significantly lower BMD at the lumbar spine (mean difference -0.44, 95% CI -0.8 to -0.08) and radial sites (one-third radius, mean difference -0.75, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.12), but not at the femoral neck (-0.5, 95% CI -1.08 to 0.08).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although BMD is lower in patients requiring dialysis, it is uncertain if BMD by DXA can be used to predict fracture risk in this population [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/6\">",
"     6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Prospective studies in patients with end stage CKD (particularly, G5D) are required to address this question. DXA is unable to predict the type of bone lesion in these patients [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/17,23,24\">",
"     17,23,24",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The quantitative bone histomorphometric classification of renal bone diseases (eg, renal osteodystrophy) includes a heterogeneous group of bone diseases, all of which may have low T-scores and fragility fractures [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"UTD.htm?36/19/37178/abstract/25,26\">",
"     25,26",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In addition, the interpretation of DXA may be confounded by the presence of extraosseous calcification and focal areas of osteosclerosis, which may lead to artifactual increase in BMD.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Although DXA is the most commonly used technique to assess BMD in patients with and without CKD, it has some limitations. DXA measures areal BMD, rather than volumetric BMD. In addition, it cannot distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone, and it cannot assess bone microarchitecture or bone turnover.

"    The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision-making required to meet individual patient needs. Level of severity is determined by both impairment and risk. Assess impairment domain by patient's/caregiver's recall of previous two to four weeks. Symptom assessment for longer periods should reflect a global assessment such as inquiring whether the patient's asthma is better or worse since the last visit. Assign severity to the most severe category in which any feature occurs. At present, data are inadequate to correlate frequencies of exacerbations with different levels of asthma severity. For treatment purposes, patients who had &ge;2 exacerbations requiring oral systemic glucocorticoids in the past six months, or &ge;4 wheezing episodes in the past year, and who have risk factors for persistent asthma may be considered the same as patients who have persistent asthma, even in the absence of impairment levels consistent with persistent asthma.",
