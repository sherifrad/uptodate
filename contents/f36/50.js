"      WHAT IS ECT?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for certain psychiatric disorders. ECT is most commonly used to treat severe depression (major depression). It is often the fastest and best treatment available for this illness. ECT is also sometimes used to treat other psychiatric disorders, such as:",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Mania, a condition that makes you feel very happy or angry; sleep less; have lots of energy; and behave strangely; or",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Psychosis, a condition that can make you lose touch with reality; have false, fixed beliefs; or hear voices of people who are not there",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     During ECT, a small amount of electrical current is passed through the brain. This current causes a seizure that affects the entire brain, including the parts that control mood, appetite, and sleep.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      HOW DOES ECT WORK?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     ECT causes chemical changes in the brain that relieve severe depression. While scientists do not yet fully understand exactly how ECT does this, they know it causes helpful changes to the molecules and cells of the brains of people with depression. One thing that is clear is that the treatment works very well; more than 70 percent of depressed people who receive it respond favorably, making it the most effective treatment for severe depression. (See",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/28/41416?source=see_link\">",
"      \"Unipolar major depression in adults: Indications for and efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\"",
"     </a>",
"     .)",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     If your doctor suggests that you be treated with ECT, it is because he or she believes that you have a disorder that will improve with ECT. Discuss this with your doctor.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Before ECT begins, your doctor will carefully assess your medical condition to make sure that ECT is safe for you. He or she will examine you, ask you about your medical history, and run tests. For example, you will probably have blood tests and a test called an \"electrocardiogram\" (ECG) to check the condition of your heart. These tests will also help the doctor make sure that there is no other medical problem causing your psychiatric symptoms.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      HOW MANY TIMES WILL I NEED TO BE TREATED?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     People undergoing ECT need multiple treatments. The number needed to successfully treat severe depression can range from 4 to 20, but most people need a total of 6 to 12 treatments. The treatments are usually given three times a week &mdash; Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      WHAT SHOULD I DO TO PREPARE FOR EACH SESSION?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     You must not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your scheduled treatment. If you smoke, do not smoke the morning of your treatment. Smoking beforehand could cause problems during the treatment.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\">",
"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE ECT PROCEDURE?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Before you receive the treatment, a doctor or nurse will place a needle into a vein in your arm (IV). That way, the medical team can easily give you the medications you need before and during the procedure. (See",
"     <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?12/52/13128?source=see_link\">",
"      \"Technique for performing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults\"",
"     </a>",
"     .)",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Although you will be asleep during the treatment, the medical team will need to start preparing you for the treatment while you are still awake. The team will:",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"      <li>",
"       Place sensors called electrodes on your head, so that they can measure the electrical activity in your brain. To do this, they will use a device called an EEG, or \"electroencephalogram.\"",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Place electrodes on your chest, so that they can measure the electrical activity in your heart. To do this, they will use a device called an ECG, or \"electrocardiogram.\"",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Wrap a blood pressure cuff around your arm, so that they can monitor your blood pressure during the procedure.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Put a small sensor on one of your fingers called a \"pulse oximeter,\" which will allow them to measure the amount of oxygen in your blood. This will tell them if you are breathing normally.",
"      </li>",
"      <li>",
"       Give you oxygen through a mask or a tube that rests below your nose. You will get oxygen throughout the whole procedure, until you wake up.",
"      </li>",
"     </ul>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     When everything is connected, the medical team will test the ECT machine to make sure that it is set properly for you. Next, a doctor or nurse will inject you with a medication (such as methohexital) that will make you go to sleep for 5 to 10 minutes. When you are asleep, you will get another injection, of a muscle relaxant (succinylcholine). This will keep you from moving about during the treatment. The muscle relaxant may cause mild muscle soreness after the treatment, but this soreness will pass.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Once your medical team is sure that you are deeply asleep and that your muscles are completely relaxed, they will administer the ECT treatment. Because you will be asleep, you will experience no pain during the treatment and will not feel the current or the seizure. If you were watching the treatment instead of receiving it, you would see your toes wiggling or other parts of your body moving a little &mdash; but not much else.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\">",
"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE TREATMENT?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     When you wake up after treatment, you may feel confused. This is partially due to the anesthesia and partially due to the treatment. In most people, the confusion passes within an hour. You may also have a headache the day of the treatment. A pain reliever, if necessary, usually helps. Other side effects, such as nausea, typically last only for a few hours.",
"    </p>",
"    <p class=\"headingAnchor2\" id=\"H7\">",
"     <span class=\"h2\">",
"      Memory loss",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;You may have some memory loss until you complete all of your treatments. This memory loss should gradually reverse itself over the course of several weeks. However, you may never remember many things that happened to you shortly before, during, or soon after your course of treatment.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     To speed and improve recovery of your memory, use your brain. Read, ask questions, and watch continuing stories on TV. This is the best way for you to help your memory return.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Because of the short-lived side effects on your memory, it is important that you postpone any major decisions until a week or two after the ECT course. It is also important that you do not drive during your course of ECT.",

"      When will my depression lift?",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Some people start to feel somewhat better after 2 to 4 treatments, but many do not get the full benefit of the treatment until later in the treatment course.",

"     <span class=\"h1\">",
"      DOES ECT HAVE ANY RISKS?",
"     </span>",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Yes, like any medical procedure, ECT has some risks. In rare cases, ECT can cause heart rhythm problems, or other potentially serious complications. In patients with pre-existing heart disease, there is an increased risk of these complications. If you have a heart condition, your doctor will take special care to monitor your heart and take other precautions with you, so that the treatment is as safe as possible. For instance, he or she might give you medicines to offset the effects of the ECT, if necessary.",

"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frostbite is a severe, localized cold-induced injury. Immersion foot (also referred to as Trench Foot) is a non-freezing cold injury (NFCI) that may also cause tissue loss and long-term sequelae. Milder forms of injury include frostnip and pernio:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Frostnip refers to cold-induced, localized paresthesias that resolve with rewarming. There is no permanent tissue damage.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Pernio, or chilblain, is characterized by localized inflammatory lesions that can result from acute or repetitive exposure to damp cold above the freezing point. Lesions are edematous, often reddish or purple, and may be very painful or pruritic. Pernio is most common in young women, but both sexes and all age ranges may be affected [",

"     <li>",
"      Immersion foot involves injury to the sympathetic nerves and vasculature of the feet. It was first described in 1914 during World War I trench warfare. It results from prolonged exposure of the feet to a combination of dampness and cold. Tight-fitting boots exacerbate the condition. Feet, and occasionally hands, are red, edematous, can be numb or extremely painful, and often covered with hemorrhagic bullae. Tissue loss can occur.",
"      <br/>",
"      <br/>",
"      Improved foot hygiene including better boot design and frequent sock changes resulted in a much lower prevalence among soldiers by 1917. Not just of historical significance, trench foot was a major medical issue during the Falklands War of 1982 and still occurs, especially among the homeless [",

"     PATHOPHYSIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The tissue destruction of frostbite is due to both immediate cold-induced cell death and the more gradual development of localized inflammatory processes and tissue ischemia. Following exposure to subfreezing temperatures, ice crystals form extracellularly. If freezing is rapid, ice crystals may also form inside cells. Fluid and electrolyte fluxes cause lysis of cell membranes with subsequent cell death. An inflammatory process ensues mediated by thromboxane A2, prostaglandin F2-alpha, bradykinins, and histamine. This leads to tissue ischemia and necrosis. The initial cellular damage and the subsequent inflammatory processes are made worse in the setting of thawing followed by refreezing of the affected area [",

"     CLASSIFICATION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A number of systems to classify frostbite have been developed based on initial clinical presentation, findings on scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate, and outcome [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37671/abstract/3,8,9\">",
"     3,8,9",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The traditional classification system divides frostbite into four degrees of severity based upon the depth of tissue involvement, in similar fashion to the classification of burns:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      First-degree frostbite is very superficial and is characterized by a central area of pallor and anesthesia of the skin surrounded by edema.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Second-degree frostbite is recognized by large blisters containing clear fluid surrounded by edema and erythema, developing within 24 hours and extending to or nearly to the tips of digits. The blisters may form an eschar, but this later sloughs off, revealing healthy granulation tissue. There is no tissue loss.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Third-degree frostbite differs from second-degree in that the injury is deeper and the blisters are smaller, hemorrhagic and more proximal. The skin forms a black eschar in one to several weeks.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Fourth-degree frostbite, which extends to muscle and bone, involves complete tissue necrosis. Mummification occurs in 4 to 10 days.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The traditional system gives clinicians a false sense of accuracy. It has caused many to treat frostbite injuries as if they were burns, with suboptimal results. Depending upon rewarming methods and complications, such as infection or trauma, first and second-degree frostbite can unexpectedly become third or fourth-degree.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A more practical classification scheme categorizes frostbite injuries as superficial or deep. Superficial frostbite corresponds to first and second-degree injury. Deep frostbite corresponds to third and fourth-degree injury [",

"     RISK FACTORS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Risk factors for developing frostbite and cold-induced injury include anything that increases localized heat loss or decreases heat production. Examples include increased convective heat loss due to exposure to wind or conductive heat loss due to contact with metal or water [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37671/abstract/12\">",
"     12",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Exhaustion, dehydration, malnutrition, or comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or mental illness may limit an individual's ability to respond to a cold stress. Alcohol abuse predisposes to frostbite as a result of acute behavioral changes, increased heat loss from vasodilation, and chronic complications of alcohol consumption [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37671/abstract/13\">",
"     13",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Other risk factors for developing frostbite include smoking, previous cold injury, and exposure of the hands and arms to vibration, which can elicit a Raynaud phenomenon associated with white fingers in some individuals [",

"     14-16",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Use of clothing that provides inadequate insulation or coverage, or is damp, too tight, or permeable to wind, can predispose to frostbite, as can use of protective ointments, such as on the face. Excessive sweating of the hands and feet increases an individual's risk of frostbite to those areas, illustrating the importance of clothing that is able to wick moisture away from the skin [",

"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    While generally considered a disease associated with environmental exposure to cold, frostbite has also been reported following direct exposure to freezing materials. As an example, the application of ice packs to reduce swelling from musculoskeletal injuries can cause frostbite [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37671/abstract/20\">",
"     20",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Some researchers hypothesize that individual variation in cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) corresponds to the risk of frostbite. One small, observational study of marines during winter deployment suggests that faster and greater CIVD may decrease risk [",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Areas most frequently affected by frostbite include the ears, nose, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. Frostbite of the cornea has been reported in individuals who keep their eyes open against very strong winds [",

"    ]. Before rewarming, the skin is insensate, white or grayish-yellow in color, and hard or waxy to touch. As noted above, bullae containing clear or bloody fluid may develop after thawing, depending on the depth of the injury. In cases of delayed presentation to medical care, eschar or other signs of tissue necrosis may be observed.",

"     DIAGNOSIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Diagnosis is generally made on clinical grounds, based on the context of the injury, signs, and symptoms. Diagnostic studies are helpful in determining the existence of comorbidities, the extent of frostbite injury, and prognosis. Because frostbite is a disease of morbidity, not mortality, more immediate life-threats, such as coexisting hypothermia, must be identified and addressed first. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, immune-mediated condition characterized by the appearance of distinctive target-like lesions on the skin. These lesions are often accompanied by erosions or bullae involving the oral, genital,",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    ocular mucosae. Erythema multiforme major is the term used to describe EM with mucosal involvement; erythema multiforme minor refers to EM without mucosal disease.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    A variety of factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of EM. The disorder is most commonly induced by infection, with herpes simplex virus being the most frequent precipitator. The clinical course of EM is usually self-limited, resolving within weeks without significant sequelae. However, in a minority of cases, the disease recurs frequently over the course of years.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Similarities in clinical and histopathologic findings have led to controversy over the distinction between EM and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), an often drug-induced disorder that may present with cutaneous targetoid lesions and mucosal erosions. However, there is suggestive evidence that EM with mucous membrane involvement and SJS are different diseases with distinct causes [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The term erythema multiforme major should",
"    <strong>",
"     not",
"    </strong>",
"    be used to refer to SJS. (See",
"    <a class=\"medical medical_review\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?17/29/17882?source=see_link&amp;anchor=H25#H25\">",

"    The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of acute and recurrent EM will be reviewed here. The treatment of EM and similar issues related to SJS are discussed separately. (See",

"     EPIDEMIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The annual incidence of EM is unknown, although it is estimated to be far less than 1 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. EM most frequently occurs in young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 and exhibits a slight male predominance. Children and older adults can also be affected [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",
"    </a>",

"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     ETIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Many factors, including infections, medications, malignancy, autoimmune disease, immunizations, radiation, sarcoidosis, and menstruation have been linked to the development of EM [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Infections (viral, bacterial, or fungal) account for approximately 90 percent of cases, with HSV as the most commonly identified precipitant (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64893 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?9/37/9820\">",
"     table 1",

"     2,4-6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is another important cause of EM, particularly in children [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/2,7\">",
"     2,7",
"    </a>",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    In less than 10 percent of cases, drugs induce EM [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A wide variety of medications have been associated with the eruption [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The most common precipitators include NSAIDs, sulfonamides, antiepileptics, and antibiotics (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64893 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?9/37/9820\">",
"     table 1",

"     PATHOGENESIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Much of the available data on the pathogenesis of this disorder have been derived from studies investigating HSV-associated EM. The development of EM secondary to HSV infection is thought to involve a cell-mediated immune process directed against viral antigens deposited in lesional skin [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/8\">",
"     8",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The detection of HSV DNA in skin biopsy specimens from patients with EM supports this theory [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/8-13\">",
"     8-13",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The following mechanism has been proposed for the development of mucocutaneous lesions in the setting of HSV infection [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/14,15\">",
"     14,15",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      Virus released into the blood during reactivation of HSV infection is phagocytosed by circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells, particularly Langerhans cells.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Langerhans cells containing HSV travel to the epidermis, where they transfer viral DNA fragments to epidermal keratinocytes. The migration of Langerhans cells to the epidermis is facilitated by virus-induced upregulation of E-cadherin expression on Langerhans cells and the presence of adhesion molecules on microvascular endothelial cells.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Expression of HSV genes in the skin leads to the recruitment of HSV-specific CD4+ Th1 cells that produce interferon (IFN) gamma in response to viral antigens.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The release of IFN-gamma initiates an inflammatory cascade that promotes the lysis of HSV-infected keratinocytes and the recruitment of autoreactive T-cells. These events lead to the epidermal damage and the inflammatory infiltrate that characterize cutaneous lesions of EM.",
"     </li>",
"    </ul>",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It is unclear whether a similar pathway is responsible for the development of EM related to other inciting agents. In drug-induced EM, the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha rather than IFN-gamma correlates with the development of skin lesions [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/15\">",
"     15",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, EM has occurred in the setting of TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/16\">",
"     16",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    EM does not occur in most people infected with HSV, and does not appear with every recurrence of HSV infection among individuals with a history of HSV-associated EM [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/17\">",
"     17",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The reason for this is unknown. It is postulated that a variety of factors may influence the development of EM, such as the presence of a key peripheral blood mononuclear cell subset, differences in the processing of viral DNA by phagocytic cells, variation in the specific viral proteins expressed in the skin, or the presence of other factors that affect the development of the autoreactive immune response [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/14,15\">",
"     14,15",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Genetic susceptibility may play a role in the preferential development of EM. In a study of 35 patients with EM and 80 controls, the HLA-DQB1*0301 allele was detected more frequently in patients with erythema multiforme than in the control population (66 versus 31 percent, respectively) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/18\">",
"     18",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37672/abstract/18\">",
"     18",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Associations with HLA types Aw33, DRw53, B15(62), B35, and DQ3 have also been reported; however, the relationship of Aw33 and DQ3 to EM has been questioned [",

"      The pathogenesis of HSV-induced EM is thought to involve a cell-mediated immune process directed against viral antigens deposited in lesional skin. Genetic susceptibility may also play a role in the development of the disorder. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Pathogenesis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The target lesion is a characteristic finding in EM, although not present in all patients. Target lesions consist of three concentric zones of color change: a central dusky or blistered area, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring of edema, and a peripheral erythematous halo. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H6\">",
"       'Cutaneous features'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Cutaneous lesions frequently begin on the extensor acral extremities, and may spread centripetally to other areas. Lesions are usually asymptomatic, although some patients may note pruritus or a burning sensation. EM may also involve mucosal surfaces, presenting as painful erythematous patches, erosions, or bullae. EM resolves in approximately two weeks. Some patients with EM may experience frequently recurring disease.(See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H5\">",
"       'Clinical manifestations'",
"      </a>",
"      above and",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",

"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The diagnosis of acute erythema multiforme typically is based upon the patient's history and clinical findings. When the diagnosis is uncertain, skin biopsies are useful for establishing the diagnosis. Direct immunofluorescence studies are usually indicated to exclude the possibility of autoimmune blistering disease. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H15\">",
"       'Evaluation and diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      HSV infection is the most common cause of erythema multiforme, and the possibility of HSV-induced disease should be considered in all patients. Serologic testing is useful for excluding HSV-associated EM when negative. However, it cannot identify a recurrent episode of HSV infection. Where available, HSV detected in skin biopsy specimens can also be used to confirm HSV-induced disease. (See",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the United States as greater than 21 days of mechanical ventilation for at least six hours per day [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37673/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ], although many studies have used an alternative duration to define PMV. It is estimated that between 4 and 13 percent of mechanically ventilated patients require PMV [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37673/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",
"    </a>",
"    ], resulting in between 7250 and 11,400 patients undergoing PMV at any one time [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37673/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. PMV is associated with increased health care cost, morbidity, and mortality [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37673/abstract/2,3\">",
"     2,3",
"    </a>",
"    ].",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Issues related to PMV are reviewed here, including predictors, weaning, complications, and outcomes. Issues related to the evaluation and management of patients who are difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, as well as the selection of such patients for transfer to a long-term acute care facility where prolonged mechanical ventilation usually occurs, are discussed separately. (See",

"     PREDICTORS",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Prediction of which patients will require PMV is discussed here, whereas prediction of successful liberation from mechanical ventilation is described elsewhere. (See",

"     \"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing\"",

"    .)",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    There are no evidence-based predictors that can reliably identify patients who will require PMV. Studies have sought to identify such predictors, but their results are difficult to generalize because they examined varying durations of mechanical ventilation and specific patient populations. In addition, attempts to validate potential predictors have found poor sensitivity and specificity.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    One of the few studies examining general medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients prospectively followed 5915 patients that required mechanical ventilation on the first day of their ICU admission. The relative contribution of various patient- and disease-related variables to the duration of mechanical ventilation was identified. The following variables were reported as being associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, with their relative contribution shown in parentheses [",

"    The development of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) appears to be a predictor of PMV. This was illustrated by an observational study of 64 patients deemed ready to wean from mechanical ventilation [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37673/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The patients with confirmed CIP required mechanical ventilation for a longer duration than patients without CIP (median of 34 versus 14 days) [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?36/50/37673/abstract/5\">",
"     5",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The relationship between CIP and duration of mechanical ventilation persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio 15.5, 95% CI, 4.55-52.3).",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    It is likely that peripheral weakness also predicts the duration of mechanical ventilation because it is a marker of respiratory muscle weakness. In an observational study of 116 patients who were mechanically ventilated for seven days or more, the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength score correlated with the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and vital capacity (VC) [",

"    Diagnosis of pneumonia in patients undergoing PMV is particularly difficult because the airways of these patients are frequently colonized with bacteria. This was illustrated by a study that performed quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage in 14 asymptomatic patients who required PMV [",

"    Many patients are transferred from the ICU to a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility for PMV and weaning. Although pneumonia is the most common infectious disease in patients that require PMV, little data exists regarding the epidemiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia in LTAC. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the causative microorganisms are initially the same as those prevalent in the ICU of origin and later the flora prevalent in the LTAC [",

Examples of tracheostomy complications include loss of airway patency due to unplanned decannulation, fistula formation between the trachea and the innominate artery, and obstruction of the tracheal tube can occur due to mucous plugging or the development of granulation tissue.

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Estimates of mortality and other clinical outcomes vary considerably for patients undergoing PMV. The variability probably reflects whether the population studied is a general population of patients requiring PMV or a subset of patients selected for their high weaning potential. It may also reflect the transfer practices (from the ICU to a long-term acute care [LTAC] facility) of the hospitals studied, as hospitals that more readily transfer patients from the ICU to an LTAC have been shown to have lower mortality rates and shorter lengths of stay [",

"    The comorbidities of obesity in childhood and adolescence include abnormalities in the endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, orthopedic, neurologic, dermatologic, and psychosocial systems [",

"    </a>",

Moreover, obesity during adolescence increases the risk for disease and premature death during adulthood, independent of obesity during adulthood [",

"     6-9",

Therefore, the benefits of performing a liver biopsy may not outweigh the costs and risks, unless there are specific features that suggest more severe or progressive liver disease, or that raise concerns about an alternate cause of the liver disease which requires evaluation by liver biopsy.

"      The metabolic syndrome describes the clustering of abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Several different schemes have been used to define the metabolic syndrome in adolescents (",

PCOS can include a variety of clinical abnormalities, including hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, acanthosis nigricans, acne, and seborrhea. In some patients the diagnosis may be difficult to establish during adolescence. Obesity during adulthood is also associated with reduced fertility. (See",

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring detects hypertension in about 50 percent of children and adolescents with obesity. (See",

The typical pattern is one of elevated concentration of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased concentration of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol.

Approximately 10 percent of obese children and adolescents have mildly elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations, which are usually caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Vitamin E (800 int. units daily) leads to histological improvement in NAFLD in children, but there is insufficient information to develop specific recommendations for its use in clinical practice.
