"      ALLERGIC RHINITIS OVERVIEW",

"    <p>",
"     Rhinitis refers to inflammation of the nasal passages. This inflammation can cause a variety of annoying symptoms, including sneezing, itching, nasal congestion, runny nose, and post-nasal drip (the sensation that mucus is draining from the sinuses down the back of the throat).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Brief episodes of rhinitis are usually caused by respiratory tract infections with viruses (eg, the common cold). Chronic rhinitis is usually caused by allergies, but it can also occur from overuse of certain drugs, some medical conditions, and other unidentifiable factors.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     For many people, rhinitis is a lifelong condition that waxes and wanes over time. Fortunately, the symptoms of rhinitis can usually be controlled with a combination of environmental measures, medications, and immunotherapy (also called allergy shots).",

"    <p>",
"     Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, affects approximately 20 percent of people of all ages. The risk of developing allergic rhinitis is much higher in people with asthma or eczema and in people who have a family history of asthma or rhinitis.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Allergic rhinitis can begin at any age, although most people first develop symptoms in childhood or young adulthood. The symptoms are often at their worst in children and in people in their 30s and 40s. However, the severity of symptoms tends to vary throughout life; many people experience periods when they have no symptoms at all.",

"      ALLERGIC RHINITIS CAUSES",

"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Allergic rhinitis is caused by a nasal reaction to small airborne particles called allergens (substances that provoke an allergic reaction). In some people, these particles also cause reactions in the lungs (asthma) and eyes (allergic conjunctivitis).",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The allergic reaction is characterized by activation of two types of inflammatory cells, called mast cells and basophils. These cells produce inflammatory substances, such as histamine, which cause fluid to build up in the nasal tissues (congestion), itching, sneezing, and runny nose. Over several hours, these substances activate other inflammatory cells that can cause persistent symptoms.",

These drugs have few side effects and dramatically relieve symptoms in most people. Studies have shown that nasal glucocorticoids are more effective than oral antihistamines for symptom relief [",

These drugs differ with regard to the frequency of doses, the spray device, and cost, but all are similarly effective for treating all the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     People with severe rhinitis may need to use a nasal decongestant for a few days before starting a nasal glucocorticoid to reduce nasal swelling, which will allow the nasal spray to reach more areas of the nasal passages (see",

"     Some symptom relief may occur on the first day of therapy with nasal glucocorticoids, although their maximal effectiveness may not be noticeable for days to weeks. For this reason, nasal glucocorticoids are most effective when used regularly. Some people are able to use lower doses when symptoms are less severe.",

"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Nasal sprays work best when they are used properly and the medication remains in the nose rather than draining down the back of the throat. If the nose is crusted or contains mucus, it should be cleaned with a saline nasal spray before a nasal spray that contains medication.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     The head should be positioned normally or with the chin slightly tucked. The spray should be directed away from the nasal septum (the cartilage that divides the two sides of the nose). The spray is dispensed and then sniffed in slightly to pull it into the higher parts of the nose. Sniffing too hard will result in the medicine draining down the throat, and should be avoided.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Some people find that holding one nostril closed with a finger improves their ability to draw the spray into the upper nose. Medicine that drains into the throat should be spit out, since it is not effective unless it remains in the nose.",

"      Side effects",
"     </span>",
"     &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The side effects of nasal steroids are mild and may include a mildly unpleasant smell or taste or drying of the nasal lining. In some people, nasal steroids cause irritation, crusting, and bleeding of the nasal septum, especially during the winter. These problems can be minimized by reducing the dose of the nasal steroid, applying a moisturizing nasal gel or spray to the septum before using the spray, or switching to a water-based (rather than an alcohol-based) spray.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Studies suggest that nasal steroids are generally safe when used for many years. However, people who use these drugs for years should have periodic nasal examinations to check for rare side effects, such as nasal infection.",
"    </p>",
"    <p>",
"     Steroids taken as a pill or inhaled into the lungs can have side effects, especially when taken for long periods of time. However, the doses used in nasal steroids are low and are NOT associated with these side effects. However, clinicians usually recommend using the lowest effective dose.",

Allergy shots are only available for common allergens, such as pollens, cat and dog dander, dust mites, and molds. These shots contain solutions of the allergens to which a specific person is allergic, and are made up individually for each person. The process of immunotherapy changes the person's immune response to the allergens over time. As a result, being exposed to the allergen causes fewer or even no symptoms.",

Immunotherapy can be expensive, but many insurance plans cover the therapy because long-term use of allergy medications is also costly.",

"     INTRODUCTION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A ureterocele is a cystic dilatation of the terminal ureter within the bladder",
"    <span class=\"nowrap\">",
"     and/or",
"    </span>",
"    the urethra (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79559 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?22/42/23201\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). It may present as an incidental finding on antenatal ultrasonography, or postnatally because of symptoms due to urinary tract infection or obstruction.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Ureterocele, including its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, evaluation, and management will be reviewed here.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     EPIDEMIOLOGY",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;At autopsy, the incidence of ureteroceles has been reported as 1 in 500 cases [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/1\">",
"     1",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Ureteroceles occur four to six times more frequently in females than in males, and more commonly in Caucasians than in other races [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Unilateral ureteroceles occur with similar frequency on the right and left, and in 10 percent of cases, there is bilateral involvement.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     CLASSIFICATION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The classification system adopted by the Urologic section of the American Academy of Pediatrics divides ureteroceles based on their location [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/3\">",
"     3",
"    </a>",
"    ]. According to this system, ureteroceles are classified as intravesical (ie, entirely within the bladder) or ectopic (ie, a portion extends beyond the bladder neck into the urethra) (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79559 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?22/42/23201\">",
"     figure 1",
"    </a>",
"    ). At times, differentiating between intravesical and ectopic ureteroceles may be difficult. Historically, ectopic ureteroceles that inserted beyond the bladder neck into the urethra were called cecoureteroceles.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Ureteroceles also may be classified depending upon whether they are associated with either a single collecting system (ie, single ureter and kidney) or a duplex system (complete ureteral duplication). Approximately 80 percent of ureteroceles are associated with the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, and 60 percent of these are ectopic [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Whereas, intravesical ureteroceles are more common in single systems.",
"   </p>",
"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     PATHOGENESIS",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The underlying pathogenesis is unknown, and it appears that a single unifying theory does not explain how all the different types of ureteroceles are formed [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. A simple explanation is that ureteroceles can be considered a diverticulum of the distal ureter within the bladder, secondary to a stenotic ureteral orifice.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    More formal proposed embryologic mechanisms resulting in ureterocele formation include [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]:",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    <ul class=\"bullet-block\">",
"     <li>",
"      An incomplete breakdown of the ureteral membrane between the ureteral bud and mesonephric duct, resulting in an obstruction that causes the formation of a ureterocele. This mechanism explains the formation of the majority of stenotic ureteroceles but not those with patulous ureteral orifices in the urethra.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Obstruction of the ureteral orifice by the bladder neck because of developmental delay in the timing of the ureteral bud insertion into the bladder.",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Abnormal induction of the bladder trigone development that results in the absence of trigonal musculature in the intravesical portion of ureteroceles.",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. Approximately 2 percent of cases of antenatal hydronephrosis are caused by ureteroceles, which obstruct the distal end of the affected ureter (",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The most common postnatal presentation is during an evaluation for urinary tract infection (UTI) in the first few months after birth [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",

"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/2\">",
"     2",
"    </a>",
"    ]. In older children, stasis and infection may predispose to stone formation. Hematuria is a rare presentation.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Some patients may present with a palpable abdominal mass due to ureterocele obstruction of the distal ureter. Most ureteroceles decompress during voiding, so bladder outlet obstruction (ie, urethral obstruction) is a rare event [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",
"    ]. However, prolapse of an ectopic ureterocele can cause urethral obstruction, and may present as a vaginal mass in girls. A girl with a large intraurethral ectopic ureterocele may present with urinary incontinence due to laxity of the external urinary sphincter. A few patients, particularly older males with a single system intravesical ureterocele, may be diagnosed incidentally during imaging for other conditions.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\">",
"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The diagnosis is generally made by ultrasonography. Further imaging by voiding cystourethrography and renal scan is used to determine whether there are associated renal and urologic abnormalities.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Ultrasound",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ultrasonography usually will reveal a well-defined cystic intravesical mass in the posterior portion of the bladder. A dilated proximal ureter also may be seen. In duplex systems, there is about an 80 percent chance that the other side will be duplex (",
"    <a class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60076 \" href=\"mobipreview.htm?18/63/19455\">",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Voiding cystourethrogram",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is important to identify whether vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is present. Reflux into the ipsilateral lower pole occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients, where it may be massive, and occurs on the contralateral side in 25 percent [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4-6\">",
"     4-6",
"    </a>",
"    ]. The contrast material used in this procedure may obscure the ureterocele itself, so early images, as the bladder is filling, are crucial to detect a ureterocele.",

"   <p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\">",
"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Renography",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;A renal scan is used to evaluate the relative function of all renal segments. In particular, in patients with a duplex system, the pole that is associated with the affected ureter may contribute little or no function, and may not be worth preserving when surgery is performed [",
"    <a class=\"abstract\" href=\"mobipreview.htm?40/8/41093/abstract/4\">",
"     4",
"    </a>",

"    <span class=\"h1\">",
"     MANAGEMENT",
"    </span>",
"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Management of a ureterocele depends upon multiple considerations, including the mode and age of presentation (antenatal detection or symptomatic), the type of ureterocele (ectopic or intravesical), the function of the associated renal moiety, and whether reflux is present [",

"   <p>",

"    <span class=\"h2\">",
"     Surgery",

"      Ureteroceles may present as hydroureteronephrosis by antenatal ultrasonography when the ureterocele causes obstruction of the distal portion of the affected ureter. Postnatally, the most common presentation is during an evaluation for urinary tract infection (UTI) in the first few months of life. Other less common presentations include intermittent abdominal or pelvic pain, abdominal or vaginal mass, failure to thrive, urolithiasis, urinary incontinence, and rarely hematuria. (See",

"      The diagnosis of ureterocele is generally made by ultrasound. Further studies include a voiding cystourethrogram to detect the presence or absence of reflux, and a renal scan to evaluate the function of the renal moiety associated with the ectopic ureter and detect the presence or absence of urinary flow obstruction.",

Prior to use, consider risk versus anticipated benefit with respect to individual patient&rsquo;s life expectancy, prognosis, and comorbidities. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms due to the therapy has not been established in clinical trials. Postmarketing experience indicates serious reactions, including fatalities, have occurred with deferasirox use, particularly when used in older patients with comorbidities or advanced disease. Overchelation of iron may increase development of toxicity; temporary interruption of treatment should be considered if serum ferritin &lt;500 mcg/L.

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ross River virus (RRV) is a group A arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes a disease manifest by polyarthritis and rash. The illness was first described in northern Australia in 1928 and subsequently has been observed widely through Australia and many islands of the western South Pacific. It is most the most prevalent vector borne disease in Australia. The virus can be transmitted by many mosquito species and survives in mosquito eggs in arid environments. Therefore, it has capacity to spread to other geographic areas.",

"      Ross River virus (RRV) is an arboviral infection transmitted by mosquitoes that causes an illness characterized by fever, polyarthritis, and rash. The illness was first described in northern Australia and subsequently has been observed widely throughout Australia and many islands of the western South Pacific. It is common in the tropical coastal regions of northern Australia. RRV can be transmitted by a variety of mosquito species, including Aedes vigilax, Aedes Camptorhynchus, and Culex annulirostris. Kangaroos and wallabies are the principal vertebrate hosts. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H1\">",
"       'Introduction'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Symptomatic RRV infection typically presents as acute illness with fever, arthritis, and rash. These symptoms frequently occur together but may occur in isolation. Arthritis in the wrists, knees, ankles, and finger joints is common and frequently symmetric. The rash is usually maculopapular and involves the limbs and trunk. Arthralgia may persist for up to three months. Fatigue is the most frequent constitutional symptom. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H4\">",
"       'Clinical manifestations'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The diagnosis of RRV infection is generally established by serology; the most common serologic methods are the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody test and ELISA test. A fourfold rise in HI titer is diagnostic; levels of &ge;1:1280 indicate recent infection. RRV-specific IgM persists for months after acute infection, and acute infection can be confirmed by rising IgM titers. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H11\">",
"       'Diagnosis'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      Treatment consists of supportive care, analgesics, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. (See",
"      <a class=\"local\" href=\"#H20298699\">",
"       'Treatment'",
"      </a>",
"      above.)",
"     </li>",
"     <li>",
"      The most important preventive measure is avoidance of mosquito bites. Helpful interventions include use of window and door screens, mosquito repellants, and light colored clothing. Over the long-term, drainage of mosquito breeding areas in endemic areas may be helpful to control infection. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ciguatera fish poisoning is a foodborne illness that is caused by ingestion of reef fish (eg, barracuda, amberjack, moray eel, and certain types of grouper, snapper, or parrotfish) that are contaminated with toxins that arise from",
"    <em>",
"     Gambierdiscus toxicus",
"    </em>",
"    , a single-celled organism that grows on coral reefs. Affected patients typically experience gastrointestinal, neurologic, and less commonly, cardiovascular abnormalities soon after eating a toxic fish. Treatment is primarily supportive. Prevention consists of avoidance of fish that commonly cause ciguatera poisoning.",

"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    The dinoflagellates are consumed by fish that do not appear to suffer ill effects from the toxin. Large, predatory fish (eg, barracuda, amberjack, moray eel, snapper, and certain types of grouper) concentrate the toxin in their organs and flesh, and thus, are considered most risky to human health. Ciguatera toxin-containing fish do not taste, smell, or appear unusual. Cooking, marinating, freezing, and stewing fish do not destroy the toxins.",
"   </p>",
"   <p>",
"    Ciguatoxin is a lipid soluble, heat stable, acid-resistant neurotoxin. It opens voltage-dependent sodium channels in cell membranes, triggering membrane depolarization. Ciguatoxin exposure in an animal model has caused long-term disruption of cerebral function in association with upregulation of sodium channel expression in astrocytes [",

However, unlike ciguatera fish poisoning, MS causes vertigo, bowel and bladder dysfunction, transverse myelopathy, and weakness. However, clinical findings vary significantly in patients with MS and considerable overlap with neurologic symptoms of ciguatera fish poisoning may occur.

"      Ciguatera fish poisoning is caused by consumption of fish contaminated with several distinct toxins (eg, ciguatoxin, saitotoxin, scaritoxin) that are formed by dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus, single-celled algae-like organisms that grow on and around coral reefs. These toxins are concentrated in the organs and flesh of large, predatory reef fish (eg, moray eel, amberjack, barracuda, red snapper, or grouper). Ciguatera toxin-containing fish do not taste, smell, or appear unusual. Cooking, marinating, freezing, and stewing fish do not destroy the toxins. (See",

"      The course of ciguatera fish poisoning is variable. Gastrointestinal and, if present, cardiovascular signs frequently resolve within 24 to 48 hours and rarely persist beyond four days. Neurologic abnormalities typically are more persistent, lasting from a few days to several weeks. Ingestion of alcohol, caffeine, nuts, or fish as well as excessive physical exertion can cause exacerbation or recurrence of ciguatera toxicity. (See",

"     <li>",
"      In addition to excessive physical exertion, patients with ciguatera toxicity should avoid consuming all fish, alcohol, caffeine, and nuts for at least six months from onset of illness since these actions may trigger a recurrence of symptoms. Sexual activity should be curtailed to avoid painful sexual intercourse. (See",

"      The best way to prevent ciguatera fish poisoning is to avoid eating all high-risk fish, such as barracuda, moray eel, and certain types of grouper, red snapper, and amberjack. No accurate analytical field test for caught fish is available. When in the tropics, it may be less risky to eat smaller fish and avoid eating fish organs where the toxin is concentrated. Recreational fishermen should also travel with experienced local guides who often know which reefs to avoid. (See",

"    &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of medium size and large ducts in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. The great majority of affected patients have underlying ulcerative colitis; the incidence may be as high as 90 percent when rectal and sigmoid biopsies are routinely obtained [",

Only about one-third of patients with recurrence develop progressive disease leading to retransplantation or death.

The influence of transplantation on the disease course was determined using multivariate statistical models that adjusted for the duration of follow-up and other covariates that might influence the course of IBD. The authors found that the only two independent risk factors for IBD progression were older age at the time of transplant (age &gt;30, hazard ratio 1.5) and liver transplantation itself (hazard ratio 3.129). The incidence rates for colectomy rose from 0.007 before liver transplantation to 0.025 after transplantation.",

"    A limitation of this analysis was that it did not include some potentially relevant covariates in the model such as pretransplant IBD disease activity and the extent of the disease. Furthermore, IBD disease activity was assessed retrospectively, raising the potential for misclassification since other causes of bowel disturbance may occur in the transplant setting (eg, CMV, lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Thus, this study confirms that IBD activity may progress after transplantation in some patients, but it does not provide a profile of patient characteristics or immunosuppressive regimens associated with increased risk.",

"    Timely restoration of blood flow using thrombolytic therapy is the most effective maneuver for salvaging ischemic brain tissue that is not already infarcted. There is a narrow window during which this can be accomplished, since the benefit of thrombolysis decreases in a continuous fashion over time. Thus, an important aspect of the hyperacute phase of stroke assessment and management is the rapid determination of patients who are eligible for thrombolysis (",
