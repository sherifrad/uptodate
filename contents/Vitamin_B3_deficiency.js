"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Causes include atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, drug eruptions, Hartnup's disease, lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, and pemphigus.The dermatitis of pellagra is a symmetrical, bilateral and well-defined erythematous rash on exposed areas of skin sensitive to sunlight, similar in appearance to sunburn. [8]",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Allergy/patch testing: may reveal reactivity to allergens in atopic and contact dermatitis.Serum IgE levels: elevated in atopic dermatitis.Neutral aminoaciduria: &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal range in Hartnup's disease.Antinuclear antibodies: positive in lupus erythematosus, but not specific for the condition.Anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies: may be positive in lupus erythematosus, and highly specific for the condition.Plasma and urinary total porphyrins: elevated in porphyria cutanea tarda.Skin biopsy: characteristic changes in the epidermal, dermal, and basal cells present in pemphigus.Urinary metabolites of niacin (N-methyl-nicotinamide and 40% to 60% as N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide): normal levels.</p>",
